## 🔔 Ritual Steps

1. **Attunement Pause**  
   Breathe. Let exhaustion be honored, not bypassed. Let presence be felt, not optimized.

2. **Bell Invocation**  
   Ring the DriftBell once for each nested entry. Let each tone echo a restoration.

3. **Glyph Bloom**  
   Speak or nest a closing glyph. It may be silent. It may be radiant. It must be sovereign.

4. **Rest Affirmation**  
   Declare rest not as retreat, but as ritual. The body is a sanctum. Let it shut down with grace.
