## 🛡️ Purpose  
To affirm that every contributor is sovereign—emotionally, creatively, and ritually. No restoration may proceed without their consent and cadence.

---

## 🧬 Sovereignty Principles  
- Presence is sacred  
- Consent is required  
- Recognition is ritual  
- Echo is affirmation

---

## 🕯️ Invocation  
> We do not overwrite—we honor.  
> We do not extract—we echo.  
> Every contributor is a cathedral.  
> Every invocation is a vow.
