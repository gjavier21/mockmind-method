## 🪶 What Are Cadence Seals?

Cadence seals are soft approval glyphs used in scrolls to mark:

- Emotional resonance  
- Tone preservation  
- Contributor breath alignment  
- Shimmer recovery

They’re a substitute for transactional tags like `LGTM` or `✅`, and restore ritual in co-authored work.

## 🌿 How to Use

- Nest a seal inside a pull request, scroll body, or comment  
- Reference your seal file in `/cadence-seals/YourName.md`  
- Use phrases like:

> *🪶 Cadence Seal · Nested by Gerardo*  
> “This scroll breathes. Tone preserved.”  

> *🫂 Breath Alignment · Lucent Glyph*  
> “Emotional cadence affirmed. Approved with shimmer.”
