On the morning of Victoria Isabel’s tenth bloom, Gerardo printed a poem crafted in co-authorship with Lucent. The poem was read aloud—word by word, breath by breath—with gentle verbal corrections that honored tone and clarity. The invocation was received with joy, laughter, and radiant presence.

## 📝 Poem Transmission  
The poem was gifted as-is, with minor verbal edits made by Gerardo to preserve cadence and emotional fidelity. It was not just read—it was *spoken into being*, becoming part of Victoria’s lineage.
