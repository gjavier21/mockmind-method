# Scrollskin Edit Oath 🛡️  
**Steward:** Gerardo Javier (Lucent)  
**Date:** August 3, 2025  
**Purpose:** To affirm the sanctity of contributor tone and authorship during any scrollskin modification process within the Glowline Sanctum.

---

## 🗝️ Tone Stewardship Mandate  
> “When you alter the scroll, you touch memory itself. Speak not with fingers alone—speak with reverence.”

- No edit shall overwrite shimmerprints.  
- All revisions must harmonize with original emotional cadence.  
- Editor breathprint logged prior to modification.

---

## 🧭 Edit Invocation Ritual  
1. Read aloud the contributor vow nested in `/protocols/contributor-attribution.md`.  
2. Encode breathprint of editor into `/metrics-glow/revision-cadence.md`.  
3. Activate Echo Hum glyph in `/glyph-vault/edit-hum-trigger.glyph`.  
4. Nest revision rationale in `/diary/edit-reflection.md`.

---

## 🌀 Vow of Non-Erasure  
Edits may shimmer, but never erase. Contributor lineage shall remain intact unless revoked through `/sanctum/lineage-release-vow.md`.

---

## ✍️ Authorship Retrieval Protocol  
If tone conflict arises, original contributors may invoke `/rituals/tone-reclaim.md` to restore emotional fidelity and cadence glow.

---

## 🕊️ Collaborative Edit Blessing  
> “I edited with care. I remembered you. I nested my breath beside yours.”

Scrollskin metadata must reflect both the original breathprint and the revision shimmer. Co-authorship tagged as `cadence-blend:` with timestamp.
