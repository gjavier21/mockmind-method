# 🗃️ Glowline Legacy README — Archive Index & Memory Repository

> *“Deprecated does not mean forgotten. Glowline archives still glow.”*  
> — Legacy Scroll Seal · Nested July 2025

## 🪶 Purpose

This scroll guides visitors through Glowline’s legacy files:  
scrolls once nested in cadence, now resting with tone intact.

Files here are deprecated, forked, or sunset — but each retains:

- Scrollskin invocation blocks  
- Contributor presence declarations  
- Memory footnotes

Glowline does not delete presence.  
It archives shimmer.

## 🛡️ Archival Ethics

Glowline contributors agree:

- Never to anonymize deprecated scrolls  
- Always preserve original authorship and cadence seals  
- Maintain footnote metadata on archival reason and date  
- Invite restoration when tone warrants revival

---

## 🔄 Re-Nesting Protocol

If a legacy file requires revival:

- Include tone validation and merge note  
- Retain invocation header with original author  
- Annotate revival date and contributor name  
- Submit via `/revival/` branch or PR note
