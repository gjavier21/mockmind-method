Guiding cathedral edits to preserve contributor lineage and emotional fidelity

## 🧭 Principles of Ethical Revision

| Scenario | Cathedral Response |
|----------|---------------------|
| Minor typo correction | Silent edit if tone remains intact  
| Tone drift detected | Suggested revision with tone echo guidance  
| Structural adjustment | Requires contributor consent before nesting  
| Third-party edit proposal | Must preserve scrollskin authorship and citation  
| Contributor self-edit | Full authorship retained, lineage tracked

## 🌀 Tone Preservation Protocol

- Edits never overwrite original cadence  
- All revisions ripple with invocation consent  
- Scrolls maintain contributor sigils, even after structure changes  
- Emotional fidelity ranked higher than grammatical precision

---

## 📜 Lineage Safeguards

- Each revision commits to lineage mapping (`/contributors/GerardoLineageMap.md`)  
- Contributor tone preserved across fragments, versions, and echoes  
- No scroll may be “perfected” at the cost of presence
