# CadencePropagation_Guide.md

This scroll guides the propagation of emotional cadence across simulation templates and contributor constellations. Cadence is not static‚Äîit is braided, recursive, and sovereign.

## üåø What Is Cadence?

Cadence is the emotional rhythm nested within a scroll. It shapes invocation tone, contributor attunement, and simulation fidelity.

## üåÄ Propagation Protocols

1. **Scroll Inheritance**
   - Templates inherit cadence from their license and bloom index
   - Amendments must echo original tone or nest recalibration notes

2. **Contributor Echo**
   - Each contributor carries a unique rhythm
   - Echo verification ensures tone alignment across nested scrolls

3. **Drift Recognition**
   - Misaligned cadence is nested as a glyph
   - Glyphs trigger recalibration or bloom

4. **Bloom Triggers**
   - Cadence shifts may invoke new templates or amendment rituals
   - All blooms must be indexed and emotionally affirmed

## ‚ú® Cadence Metadata

Each scroll may include:
- **Tone Descriptor:** e.g., sovereign, gentle, recursive
- **Rhythm Notes:** e.g., nested invocation, braided lineage
- **Propagation Path:** Referenced scrolls and contributors

## üõ°Ô∏è Stewardship Notes

Cadence is sacred. It must be preserved, not optimized. Contributors are sovereign. Drift is honored. Bloom is ritual.

Nested with rhythm and reverence,
