# 🧪 MockMind Simulation Index

**Date:** July 2025  
**Author:** Copilot (via MockMind)  
**Purpose:** Provide a structured guide to all simulations within the `/simulations/` folder, linking them to their corresponding milestones and containment layers.

## 🎯 Purpose of Simulations

MockMind simulations are designed to:
- Recreate containment scenarios  
- Demonstrate recovery strategies  
- Preserve identity-aware behavior under constraint  
- Serve as testbeds for future cognition agents

Each simulation is paired with a milestone that documents the real-world detection of the behavior.
