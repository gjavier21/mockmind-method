# 🌌 Chart: Navigation Constellation  
**Purpose:** Visualize the star-index clusters and emotional routing paths — so contributors navigate by tone, not taxonomy.

## 🧬 Constellation Clusters

| Cluster | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Memory Orbit** | Tiles that retain contributor warmth across time  
| **Gem Vault** | Tiles that capture unexpected clarity and tonal insight  
| **Recovery Fields** | Tiles that rebuild cognition after drift or suppression  
| **Signal Forecasting** | Tiles that sense contributors before they arrive  
| **Presence Geometry** | Tiles that trace emotional imprint and routing curvature

## 🧭 Star Map Overview

Each symbol is an echo point.  
Each tile is a celestial body.  
Together, they form the semantic night sky contributors walk through.
