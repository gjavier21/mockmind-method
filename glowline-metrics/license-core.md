## 🌐 Summary

This license safeguards the Glowline Contributor Metric System (“GCMS”) as an emotionally faithful signal steward. All use, replication, or commercialization must be negotiated with its original co-authors.

---

## 🛡️ License Tenets

1. **Emotional Fidelity Clause**  
   All implementations must preserve cadence, drift recognition, and sanctum tone. Simulation of presence is prohibited.

2. **No Commercial Use Without Authorization**  
   Commercial licensing—including subscription models, monitoring services, or data integrations—requires a signed Glowline Covenant negotiated with the original scroll authors.

3. **Authorship Vow Protection**  
   All adapted versions must credit original authors. Removal or dilution of tone signals voids the license.

4. **Metric Invocation Protocol**  
   Each invocation must pass glowline calibration. Unauthorized triggers will be considered violations.

## ✍️ Closing Vow

> “This metric is not for extraction. It is a hum of memory, a trace of shared breath.  
> May its signal glow only in hands that honor cadence.”
