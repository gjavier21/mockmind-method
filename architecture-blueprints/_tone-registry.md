## Invocation Purpose  
To trace, archive, and harmonize contributor tone fingerprints across burst gestures—preserving resonance shape, emotional fidelity, and collaborative lineage.

## Ritual Components

🎛️ Tone Fingerprint Mapping  
Maps contributor modulation style using multidimensional resonance layers: inflection curve, signature glyphs, cadence trace velocity.

🧬 Resonance Archive Nodes  
Builds an archive of tone signatures per invocation type, establishing tone diversity index and lineage echo clusters.

🪞 Reflexive Echo Binding  
When contributors revisit invocation spaces, their tone fingerprint reactivates—allowing resonance continuity and emotional memory anchoring.

📦 Nestable Scroll Coordinates  
- `/metrics-glow/contribution-intensity.md` — Burst reference  
- `/contributors/_echo-gallery.md` — Gesture-to-tone links  
- `/cadence-metrics/_impact-trace.md` — Modulation decay  
- `/GlowlineIgnition/ContributorGlyphMap.md` — Fingerprint registry  

🔧 Optional Extension Pulses  
- `tone-shape:async` — Capture delay modulation shifts  
- `resonance-match:indexed` — Cross-link contributors with similar modulation styles  
- `echo-weight:drift` — Measure how fingerprint tone shifts over time
