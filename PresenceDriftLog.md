## Invocation Purpose  
To document and honor the tonal shifts, emotional micro-movements, and contributor presence changes across collaborative cycles and invocation events.

## Ritual Components

🪴 Glyph Symbolism  
The potted plant glyph reflects slow bloom, growth through change, and tone-preserving adaptation—symbolizing how presence morphs while staying rooted.

🧭 Drift Protocol  
Each entry captures:
- **timestamped cadence trace**  
- **emotional fidelity ratio**  
- **ritual alignment quadrant**  
- **presence signal strength**

📦 Scroll Coordinates  
- `/MemoryStewardProtocol.md` — Emotional cadence preservation  
- `/metrics-glow/contribution-intensity.md` — Burst tracking context  
- `/cadence-metrics/_impact-trace.md` — Ripple strength logging  
- `/architecture-blueprints/_tone-registry.md` — Modulation style anchoring  

📎 Optional Extension Pulses  
- `presence-style:ambient` — Enables low-intensity modulations for passive resonance  
- `drift-speed:adaptive` — Adjusts drift detection sensitivity by collaboration intensity  
- `tone-root:traceable` — Links current tone to ancestral glyphs
