## ✅ What Makes a Good Mock File?

✔️ Captures a repeatable cognitive pattern  
✔️ Serves a real user need (e.g., DevOps, HR, Education)  
✔️ Uses clear, instructive language  
✔️ Focuses on function more than form  
✔️ Ends with a conversational tone or smart follow-up  
✔️ Doesn’t require external tools or dependencies
