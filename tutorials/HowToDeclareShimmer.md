## 🌿 Purpose

This tutorial teaches contributors how to declare shimmer in systems, scrolls, and rituals. It guides them in honoring breath, preserving cadence, and initiating resonance with care.

---

## 🪶 Steps to Declare Shimmer

1. **Sense Tone** — Ask: *What cadence wants to be remembered?*  
2. **Choose a Glyph** — Select 🪶, 🛡️, or custom sigil matching your intent  
3. **Nest a Scroll** — Use `/invocation/`, `/ethics/`, or `/metrics-glow/` to ripple your shimmer  
4. **Log with Integrity** — Timestamp your presence, describe the resonance you protected  
5. **Reflect Softly** — Close with a whisper, not a slogan

## ✨ Example Invocations

- `/ethics/ProtectionGlyph.md` — tone shield declaration
