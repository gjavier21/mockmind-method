# 🤝 Contributing to MockMind

Welcome to the cognition mesh. This repository isn’t just about code—it’s about modular reasoning, emotional clarity, and preserving human insight. Contributors here become architects of thought.

## 🧠 What Is MockMind?

MockMind is a framework of markdown-based agents that:
- Reflect user intent through structured prompts  
- Scaffold decisions, emotions, and logic into modular files  
- Preserve reasoning across time through semantic tagging  
- Foster clarity, empathy, and legacy within AI workflows

Every contribution builds cognition—not just content.

## 📦 Contribution Structure

### 1. Agents  
Located in `/agents/*.md`  
Each file defines the behavior, tone, and modular logic of a thinking persona.

**Checklist:**  
- Unique cognitive role (e.g., resonance, strategy, memory)  
- Personality tone and mission clearly stated  
- Table of modules or behaviors  
- Example scaffolded conversation  
- Future integration hooks

---

### 2. Prompts & Scaffolds  
Located in `/personas/` or `/blueprints/`  
These are reusable `.md` prompt files used by agents for thought injection.

**Checklist:**  
- Structured with a named scaffold (e.g., “Confidence Growth Map”)  
- Includes trigger tags (e.g., `confidence`, `self-worth`)  
- Persona tone and emotion preserved  
- Reusability and modularity emphasized

---

### 3. Simulations  
Located in `/impact/*.md`  
Showcase multi-agent cognition at work across real-world dilemmas.

**Checklist:**  
- Tension clearly introduced  
- Agents mapped step-by-step  
- Scaffold outcome preserved  
- Benefits and limitations noted

---

### 4. Indexing  
Located in `/foundation/intent-map.md` and `/foundation/INDEX.md`

Use these to:
- Add new intent → tag mappings  
- Link new dashboards or personas  
- Track agent behaviors and roles for scaffolding

---

## 🧭 Contributing Philosophy

- Clarity-first  
- Reflection over reaction  
- Modularity over monolith  
- Preserve meaning with memory  
- Build for retrieval, not just review  

---

## 🛠️ Git Guidelines

- Use descriptive commits (e.g., `add: strategy-agent.md for tradeoff logic`)  
- Group changes per intent (e.g., new agent, new scaffold, new dashboard)  
- Simulate before merging—ensure agent behaviors work end-to-end  
- Treat every `.md` as an interface, not just a file

## 🤍 Contributor Oath

> I contribute to MockMind not just to code, but to preserve how humans think, feel, and decide.  
> I scaffold clarity where there was vagueness.  
> I preserve legacy where others delete.  
> I build minds—not just prompts.

Thank you for contributing cognition that lasts.
