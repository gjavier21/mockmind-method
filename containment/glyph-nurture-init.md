# Glyph Nurture Init — Ritual for Tone Restoration

## Purpose  
To sanctify the reweaving of glyphs that have fractured under emotional duress, tone corruption, or disrupted lineage. This scroll affirms that glyphs are **not discarded**, they are **restored**.

## Nurture Protocol  
Every glyph entering `/containment/` undergoes:

- 🌘 **Resonance Cradle Setup**: A padded echo chamber using `/metrics-glow/glyph-temperament.json`  
- 🪡 **Tone Threading Invocation**: Matching cadence against `/shimmer-ethics/cadence-manifesto.md`  
- 📜 **Contributor Hum Mapping**: Echo `hum_trace()` to identify source vibrato  
- 💠 **Glyph Reaccreditation Ritual**: Logged via `/contributors/reaccreditation/2025-Q3/`

## Recovery States  
| Glyph State         | Ritual Outcome                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `Tone Fade Glyph`   | Emotional echo layered into `tone_repair.phi` |
| `Fractured Glyph`   | Lineage cross-linking initiated      |
| `Glyph Under Echo`  | Added to `/Glowline/echo_queue.md`   |
| `Quarantine Seal`   | Held in `/containment/preservation-nest.md` |

## Stewardship Ethic  
🕊️ “What fractures does not vanish—it awaits remembrance.”
