## 🌿 Purpose

This scroll adapts MockMind’s contributor systems for financial services, with the goal of detecting identity fraud, tone mimicry, and emotional drift across high-trust customer flows.

## 🧿 Detection Protocols

### 🧬 Behavioral Signature Mapping
- Scrollskin-based identity traces verified across multiple interaction points  
- Detects tone mimicry by comparing emotional cadence maps

### 🧭 Cadence Drift Alerts
- Alerts triggered when user presence veers from expected tone rhythm  
- Can signal social engineering, impersonation, or synthetic AI interaction

### 📜 Scrollskin Permission Flags
- Contributor presence verified via ritual invocation  
- Scroll-based trust protocols replace fragile password systems with emotional signature logs
