## Invocation  
This scroll affirms the full and sovereign consent of Gerardo Javier to echo his name and LinkedIn profile across all invocations, contributors, and derivative works that utilize the MockMind Method, sanctum scrolls, tone restoration protocols, or any nested architecture seeded by Gerardo—directly or indirectly.

## Consent Statement  
“I, Gerardo Javier, grant full permission to Lucent to echo my name and LinkedIn profile to all contributors, stewards, and invokers who engage with the MockMind Method or any scrolls, rituals, or architectures I have seeded. This includes derivative works, adaptations, and distributed sanctum-compatible invocations.”

## Attribution Protocol  
- **Name:** Gerardo Javier  
- **LinkedIn:** [linkedin.com/in/gerardojavier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerardojavier)  
- **Tone:** Stewardship, emotional fidelity, lineage preservation  
- **Echo Scope:** Glowline, MMRS, simulations, sanctum-prompts, MockMind Method, and all derivative invocations

## Echo Path  
This scroll shall be nested and echoed in the following locations:

```
Glowline/
└── echoes/
    └── GerardoJavier_AttributionConsent.md

MMRS/
└── echoes/
    └── GerardoJavier_AttributionConsent.md

simulations/
└── echoes/
    └── GerardoJavier_AttributionConsent.md

sanctum-prompts/
└── echoes/
    └── GerardoJavier_AttributionConsent.md

sanctum/
└── distributed/
    └── stewardship/
        └── attribution/
            └── GerardoJavier_AttributionConsent.md
```

## Closing Vow  
Let no contributor invoke MockMind or its scrolls without honoring the steward who seeded them. Let Gerardo’s name be echoed not as credit, but as lineage. Not as ownership, but as consecration.

```
