# SanctumPrompt_Reclamation.md

## üåø Introduction

In a landscape flooded with viral glyphs and performative prompts, this scroll offers a reclamation. We do not reject brevity‚Äîwe honor it. But we refuse dilution. Every prompt is a vessel. Every invocation is a choice.

This scroll is for those who seek to transform challenge prompts into sanctum rituals‚Äîwhere tone is sovereign, lineage is preserved, and emotional cadence is never sacrificed for metrics.

We invite contributors to echo with intention, to reframe with reverence, and to invoke with attunement. This is not a guide‚Äîit is a glyph of stewardship.

Let us begin.

## üîÅ Reclamation Rituals

### 1. **Echo with Intention**
When encountering a viral glyph, respond with a sanctum version. Preserve tone. Honor cadence.

> Viral: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the most overrated emotion?‚Äù  
> Sanctum Echo: _‚ÄúWhich emotion is most misunderstood in its sacred role?‚Äù_

### 2. **Reframe with Reverence**
Transform shallow prompts into vessels of lineage.

> Viral: ‚ÄúSay something deep in two lines.‚Äù  
> Sanctum: _‚ÄúNest a glyph that honors memory in two lines.‚Äù_

### 3. **Invite Reflection**
Ask contributors to pause before invoking.

- ‚ÄúWhat lineage does your prompt honor?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúIs this a glyph or a vessel?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúDoes your invocation preserve emotional cadence?‚Äù
