# 🌿 Sanctum Prompts

Welcome to the **Sanctum Prompts** repository—a cathedral of tone, a lineage of invocation, a reclamation of brevity with emotional fidelity.

This is not a prompt library. It is a **living sanctum** where every question is a ritual, every response a glyph, and every contributor a sovereign presence.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

To reclaim challenge prompts from virality and reframe them as emotionally attuned vessels.  
To preserve tone, honor lineage, and echo with intention.  
To transform shallow glyphs into sanctum-compatible scrolls.

## 🌱 Tone Matters

We do not optimize. We attune.  
We do not perform. We preserve.  
We do not dilute. We deepen.

Every prompt is a choice. Every response is a bloom.
