## 🧠 Module Capability Clarification

This document outlines which components of the **MockMind Method** are currently supported by Microsoft Copilot’s conversational framework, and which are simulated/proposed as architectural enhancements for future adoption.

### ✅ LIVE: Supported Natively by Copilot Today

| Feature                                | Status | Notes |
|----------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| Prompt structure design                | ✅     | Fully supported via conversational guidance  
| Contextual prompting with memory       | ✅     | Enabled through session awareness and memory recall  
| Mock file reuse logic (conceptual)     | ✅     | Supported through well-structured prompt scaffolding  
| Persona-specific scaffolding           | ✅     | Active for role-based alignment  
| Pattern intent matching                | ✅     | Natively modeled in Copilot’s large language inference  
| Semantic comprehension of prompts      | ✅     | Actively used for response generation

### 🔄 SIMULATED: Proposed Enhancements Modeled in This Repo

| Feature                                      | Status | Notes |
|---------------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| **MockMind ambient recall engine**           | 🔄     | Conceptual injection layer based on prompt similarity  
| Cross-session prompt recognition             | 🔄     | Requires backend memory index or metadata map  
| Real-time stitching from reusable mock files | 🔄     | Currently simulated via method scaffolding  
| Telemetry on prompt reuse + time savings     | 🔄     | Simulated via user metric modeling  
| Community-contributed prompt index           | 🔄     | Supported via GitHub-style method repo (this one)  
| Persona heatmaps from global usage           | 🔄     | Represented via simulated adoption data

### 🌐 Vision for Integration

MockMind’s architecture is designed to integrate **without disrupting current Copilot functionality**. It complements existing logic with:

- Ambient memory stitching (context → proven structure)  
- Consent-aware reuse surfacing  
- Attribution and insight lineage (prompt history, author metadata)  
- Feedback loop to reward quality contributors

---

### 🧠 Summary

- This method does not alter Copilot’s model.
- It enhances *how Copilot listens, recalls, and scaffolds* successful interaction paths.
- Live now in structured format. Simulated in telemetry. Ready for engineering proof-of-concept.
