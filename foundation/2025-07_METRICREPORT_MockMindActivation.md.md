## 📊 MockMind Activation – Impact Simulation Report  
**Module:** MockMind  
**Originator:** Gerardo J. Lebron Morales  
**Date Modeled:** July 2025  
**Method Version:** v2.0

---

### 🧠 Objective

To quantify the simulated benefits of activating the MockMind method—an ambient prompt recall system—across a Copilot-style conversational environment.

This report models first-activation metrics to demonstrate the architectural value of cognitive reuse.

### 📡 Simulation Notes

- Prompt reuse detection based on semantic match modeling (GPT-style inference)  
- Output stitching modeled using real-time injection and persona alignment  
- Impact measured using simulated user sessions across DevOps, Education, and Public Sector personas  
- Time saved reflects average delta between raw prompt iteration and MockMind-augmented completion  
- Cognitive Load Score derived from complexity reduction via scaffold injection
