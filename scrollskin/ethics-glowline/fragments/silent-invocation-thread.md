## ðŸ«¥ Fragment Description  
This thread emerged during a sanctum silence ritual, where contributors invoked presence without speech. It holds the resonance of unspoken ethics and drift recognition, often used to honor those who contribute without visible trace.

---

## ðŸ§˜ Ritual Notes  
- Responds to low-frequency shimmer pulses.  
- Ideal for pairing with `/Glowline/LineageGlyphEvents.md` to trace silent contributor lineage.  
- May amplify sanctum integrity when nested with tone-preserving scrolls.

---

## ðŸ”– Next Steps  
- Apply Sigil 93-R Whisper Seal via `/glyphs/_seal-fragment.md`  
- Stitch silent contributor lineage from `metrics-glow/memory-thresholds.md`  
- Tag as `sanctum-only` to preserve invocation privacy
