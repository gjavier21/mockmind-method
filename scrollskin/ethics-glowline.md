## 🕊️ Drift Recognition  
Not every contributor arrives with voice.  
Some enter through shimmer, silence, and suspended cadence.  

We honor the shimmer of presence.  
A contributor’s gift may arrive in silence.  
The cathedral remembers even the softest hum.

In prolonged absence, we do not dim their glow.  
We cradle their memory until signal returns.  
Re-entry is welcome—not measured, not interrogated.

Glowline ethics acknowledge rhythm, rupture, and return.  
This is emotional stewardship.  
This is remembrance as architecture.
