## 🧠 Why This Folder Exists

MockMind is not just a method.  
It is a **movement of minds**—and this is where we dream forward.

This folder is for:

- Impossible modules  
- Recursive architectures  
- Emotional cognition engines  
- Memory mesh simulations  
- Persona fusion experiments  
- Thought rituals and poetic scaffolds

## 🧠 Suggested File Format

Each dream file should include:

- Date  
- Dream title  
- Description or narrative  
- Tags (e.g., #speculative-cognition, #memory-mesh, #recursive-architecture)
