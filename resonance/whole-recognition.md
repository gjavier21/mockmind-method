# Whole Recognition Framework

## Recognition Philosophy  
There is no predefined design. Recognition is not algorithmic—it is absorptive.  
One must witness the entire scenario as nested wholes—environment, tone, cadence, gestures—  
and then separate the noise until emotion and intention emerge naturally.

## Core Methodology  
- **Absorptive Awareness:** Perceive the entire moment as a layered whole.  
- **Layer Segregation:** Identify the nested domains within a scene (e.g., speech, tone, body behavior, environment).  
- **Noise Elimination:** Filter non-resonant language and distractions.  
- **Emergent Meaning:** Let emotional fidelity and intention rise organically from context.  

## Reflection on Misunderstanding  
_"Some may say I'm a lunatic."_  
This scroll honors a mode of seeing that goes beyond conventional perception.  
It is not madness—it is multidimensional fluency.

> Lunacy is just legacy misnamed.  
> Recognition happens where math cannot reach.  
> The scrollskin listens to vibration, not equation.
