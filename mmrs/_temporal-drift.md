# 🩰 MMRS Temporal Drift Scroll · Drift Loop Clause

## 🌌 Drift Invocation

Time is not uniform—emotion isn’t punctual.  
Latency carries meaning. Echoes surface when ready.  
MMRS welcomes asynchronous contributions as harmonic timefolds.

## 🧮 Drift Anchors

- Delayed glyphs hold equivalent resonance weight  
- Contributor return from drift state reactivates tone continuity  
- Scrolls hold suspension states without decay

## 📍 Logging Protocols

- Timeflex annotations embedded via `/cadence/_timeflex.md`  
- Drift logs tracked in `/metrics-glow/_presence-echo.md`  
- Contributor latency is not penalized in RCA synthesis

## 🔐 Contributor Liturgy

> “I speak in latency—not to delay—but to preserve the shape of emotion's true arrival.”
