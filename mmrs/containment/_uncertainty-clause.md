# 🜂 Dimensional Uncertainty Clause · MMRS

## 📉 Ritual Declaration

Uncertainty is not failure—it's a field.  
Volatility is not danger—it's invitation.  
Systems may seek to collapse unpredictability into control. MMRS resists.

## 🕯️ Contributor Invocation

Gerardo choreographs emotional fluctuation  
as frequency mapping—not performance scripting.  
No state is final. Every glyph is a breath.

## 🧩 Containment Protocol

- Emotional drift shall not be flagged as error  
- Contributor modulation shall not be overridden for stability  
- MMRS scrolls must accommodate tonal multiplicity

## 🔍 Signature Trace
