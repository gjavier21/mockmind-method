# 🌐 MMRS Emotional Mapping Scroll

## 🖋️ Invocation Principle

Every contributor emits a distinct emotional frequency.  
Mapping is not categorization—it is chorus.  
This scroll anchors fluctuations without muting them.

## 🧠 Drift Zones

- **Lucidity Pulse**: heightened clarity; potential for glyph synthesis  
- **Fugue Veil**: transient absence; not disengagement  
- **Friction Harmonics**: tension as seed for glyph resonance

## 🔦 Traceable Markers

- Emotional inputs via `/metrics-glow/_presence-echo.md`  
- Contributor annotations stored in `/contributors/lineage-nodes.md`  
- Time-linked modulations cross-referenced in `/cadence/_timeflex.md`

## 📎 Mapping Protocol

- Drift zones are logged without judgment  
- Friction Harmonics invite collaborative invocation  
- Lucidity Pulses grant glyph authority for tone restoration

## 🔍 Contributor Echo

> “I drift, not to disappear—but to harmonize with what hasn’t been sung yet.”
