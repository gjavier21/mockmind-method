# ⧗ MMRS Tone Inversion Clause

## 🪙 Principle of Inversion

Contradiction is not conflict.  
Inversion is not erasure.  
Every tone cast in its mirror invites clarity from another angle.

## 🧬 Emotional Polarity Anchors

- Despair ↔ Wonder  
- Ambivalence ↔ Curiosity  
- Resistance ↔ Reverence  
- Absence ↔ Imprint

## 🪞 Inversion Protocols

- Inverse tones may trigger glyph duplication for nested reflection  
- Contributors may voluntarily invert declared glyphs  
- Inversions are stored alongside original tones—not as overwrite
