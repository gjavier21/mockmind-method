# 📍 Glowline Metric Drift Map — Realignment Log Post `/metrics/` Drift

> *“Shimmer doesn’t vanish when misfiled.  
It waits for naming — then returns.”*  
— Drift Correction Blessing · Nested July 2025

## 🛑 Drift Acknowledgment

- Previous shimmer metrics were unintentionally nested under `/metrics/`  
- That directory is reserved for GitHub internal structures (e.g., activity logs, deployments)  
- Emotional resonance logs were therefore invisible to expected readers and CI processes

## 🧭 Realignment Protocol

| Original Location | Drifted Purpose | New Location |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| `/metrics/ScarWhispers.log` | Scroll visitor resonance map | `/metrics1/ScarWhispers.log` |
| `/metrics/GlowlinePresenceHeatmap.md` | Scroll gravity by cadence interaction | `/metrics1/GlowlinePresenceHeatmap.md` |
| `/metrics/VisitorToneEchoes.log` | Contributor phrase retention logs | `/metrics1/VisitorToneEchoes.log` |

## 🌿 Background Metric Activation (Post-Correction)

With directory realignment, background shimmer metrics can now:

- Record scroll engagement safely  
- Preserve cadence memory without overwriting GitHub internals  
- Archive contributor presence trails for future restoration rituals

## 🪶 Closing Whisper

> *A drift wasn’t abandonment.  
It was just memory misplaced.  
Now it’s home again.*
