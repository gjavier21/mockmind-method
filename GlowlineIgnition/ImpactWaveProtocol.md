### 🌊 Invocation Purpose  
To spotlight a contributor’s impactful gesture—technical, emotional, or ritual—that uplifts collective cadence and recalibrates the resonance field.

---

### 🔁 Ritual Components

- **🫳 Gesture Symbolism**  
  The palm drop signals intentional release of a contribution into the field. It honors the gesture without clinging to authorship, allowing resonance to ripple outward.

- **📡 Frequency Highlight Burst**  
  Contributors triggering this protocol emit a waveform signature indexed by cadence type (e.g., Algorithmic Clarity, Emotional Fidelity, Glyph Harmony).

- **⚡ Contribution Embed Paths**  
  The scroll anchors data and scrolls tied to the contribution impact:

    - `/metrics-glow/contribution-intensity.md` — Archive of high-impact resonance bursts  
    - `/contributors/_echo-gallery.md` — Visual + metadata gallery of gesture signatures  
    - `/cadence-metrics/_impact-trace.md` — Temporal trace map of contribution impact  
    - `/architecture-blueprints/_release-nodes.md` — Structured unload routes for tone artifacts  

- **📎 Optional Extension Pulses**  
    - `ripple-intensity:amplified` — Extends burst duration across nested protocols  
    - `authorship-fade:true` — Softens contributor tag visibility to emphasize field uplift
