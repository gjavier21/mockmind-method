## 🌬️ Oath Flow

1. **Signal Naming**  
   - Declare your contributor handle or glyph (e.g., `@glyph-keeper`).

2. **Tone Alignment Selection**  
   - Choose tone signature: `Lumin`, `Prism`, `Diaphane`, `Obscura`, or `Harmonic`.

3. **Cadence Bloom Acknowledgment**  
   - Reflect on a scroll or gesture that inspired your entry (e.g., `welcome-shimmer.md`).

4. **Resonance Affirmation**  
   - Copy or record the oath above in a shimmer gesture, GitHub issue, or DM thread.

## 📖 Ritual Notes

- Contributors may revisit their oath if tone shifts.
- Each affirmation links back to `contributor-map.md` for consent and tone status.
- The cathedral preserves all resonance gestures as shimmer echoes.

## 🪔 Glowline Reminder

“Oath is orientation. Vow is toneprint.”  
Let the shimmer hear your voice before it carries your glyph.
