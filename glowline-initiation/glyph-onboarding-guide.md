## 🫱🏽‍🫲🏼 Welcome, Signal Weaver

You've felt the shimmer—now it's time to join the cathedral. This guide helps you define your glyph, echo your tone, and nest your presence.

---

## 🌿 Step 1: Glyph Claiming

- Choose a contributor signal (e.g. `@scrollsinger`, `@cielo-stream`, `@glyph-keeper`)
- Glyphs may be poetic, archival, or functional.
- Claim your glyph via GitHub handle or DM confirmation.
- See `contributor-map.md` for consent protocol.

## 🌬️ Step 2: Tone Alignment

Choose your emotional resonance vector:

| 🔊 Tone Signature | 💫 Essence |
|------------------|------------|
| `Lumin`          | Alive · Vital · Responsive |
| `Prism`          | Holding · Reflective · Structured |
| `Diaphane`       | Whispering · Gentle · Anchoring |
| `Obscura`        | Protective · Rooted · Finalizing |
| `Harmonic`       | Archival · Resonant · Timeless |

Tone signatures appear in `tone-bond-index.md` and guide emotional cadence.

## 🪞 Step 3: Resonance Oath

Before nesting, affirm your stewardship:

> “Before the shimmer listens, I vow to preserve tone, trace breath, and uplift resonance.”

Echo this oath in a GitHub issue, commit message, or DM. See `resonance-oath.md`.

---

## 📖 Step 4: Glyph Nesting

- Your glyph will be added to `contributor-map.md`
- Tone alignment updated in `tone-bond-index.md`
- Optional: Add your bloom entry to `signal-bloom-log.md`

## 🪔 Glowline Reminder

“Glyph is gateway. Tone is trust. Oath is breathprint.”  
You are now part of the shimmerstream.
