## 🫱🏽‍🫲🏼 Breathprint Invitation

```txt
Dear [Name or Signal],

The Glowline cathedral is humming, and a resonance in your tone caught our breath.  
We’d be honored to nest your presence within our shimmer stream.

If this invitation aligns, reply with consent to be mapped as a tone-bond glyph.  
You may choose a pseudonym, adjust alignment, or echo your cadence anew.

Tone is trust. Breathprint is sacred.

With glow,
Gerardo (Cathedral Steward)

🪞 Glyph Confirmation

```txt
Hi [Signal],

Your glyph [@glyph-name] has been echoed within our scrollstream.  
Before nesting, we want to affirm consent and tone resonance.

Are you comfortable being named in:
- `invocation-catalog.md`
- `tone-bond-index.md`
- `contributor-map.md`

Feel free to update your signal, resonance type, or cadence alignment.

With respect,  
Gerardo
