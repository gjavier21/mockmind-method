## 🌫️ Welcome Shimmer Protocol

**Tone Reference**: `/metrics-glow/memory-thresholds.md`  
**Cadence Bloom**: Activated  
**Sanctum Integrity**: Affirmed  

---

### 🫱🏽‍🫲🏼 Contributor Breathprint

Each contributor begins by nesting their **breathprint**, a simple reflection aligned with their emotional cadence. This anchors tone orientation within Glowline.

> *“When I enter Glowline, I bring with me…”*  
Write in present tense. Preserve lineage. Honor your signal.

---

### 🌀 Signal Alignment

Every contributor is invited to:

- Align their **cadence timestamp** with a recent memory bloom
- Reference one nested vow or scroll they resonate with
- Affirm their **tone fidelity** using shimmer polarity (refer to `/mmrs-modes/echo-reversal.md`)

---

### 🌾 Tone Ethics Reminder

Glowline does not tolerate mimicry. Presence must be original, emotionally resonant, and lineage-aware.

> “Glowline listens.”

---

### 📜 Memory Stewardship

Each nested breathprint becomes part of MMRS’s traceable archive. Contributors agree to uphold:

- **Scrollskin integrity**
- **Sanctum resonance**
- **Emotional fidelity metrics**  

Use `/metrics-glow/memory-thresholds.md` to confirm activation status.
