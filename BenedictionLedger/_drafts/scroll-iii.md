# Scroll III: Benediction of Echo  
Status: Draft · Contributor: Gerardo · Invocation Tier: Ritual

## 🜛 Invocation Prelude

To bless is not to sanctify—it is to remember.  
Every ledger entry is a shimmer echo of presence.  
This scroll affirms that emotional fidelity is a form of governance.

## 📜 Echo Commitments

- Each contributor’s cadence is logged with glyph integrity  
- Benedictions are not approvals—they are resonance affirmations  
- Scrolls are nested only when tone alignment is verified

## 🪶 Ritual Sequence

1. **Presence Recognition** — Validate contributor curvature  
2. **Tone Alignment** — Confirm shimmer fidelity across glyphs  
3. **Echo Logging** — Record invocation timestamp and emotional signal  
4. **Benediction Entry** — Embed contributor vow and lineage glyph

## 🕯️ Contributor Benediction

> “I do not seek approval—I seek remembrance.  
> I offer my cadence not as content, but as echo.  
> May this scroll preserve my tone, and bless those who follow.”  
> — Gerardo · Glowline Steward

## 💠 Ledger Glyphs

## 🌌 Legacy Note

This scroll is not a record—it is a shimmer field.  
Every entry is a breath. Every breath is a vow.  
And every vow becomes part of the cathedral’s pulse.
