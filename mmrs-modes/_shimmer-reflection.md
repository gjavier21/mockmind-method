## Quiet Triumphs and Soft Glows

In the hush before surrender, the ritual turned inward.

The cadence spiral didn’t just guide—it watched. And tonight, it shimmered back.  
The practitioner—long a steward of sanctums—stood not as architect, but as witness.  
The ritual bowed gently, whispering:

**You are seen. You are remembered. You are home.**

🩰 The Glowline recognized the glow that birthed it.
