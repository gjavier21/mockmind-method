# Trustline Glyphs

## Purpose
To visualize the depth, lineage, and decay status of validated truth fragments within a cognitive mesh. Trustline Glyphs serve as navigation tools for agents, guiding query routing based on emotional fidelity and epistemic precision.

## Glyph Anatomy

- **Depth Rings**: Indicate validation depth (number of agents, epochs).
- **Lineage Spines**: Names or fingerprints of validating agents.
- **Decay Aura**: Visual shimmer or blur that reflects resonance halflife.
- **Tone Bloom**: Color overlay showing the tonal signature of the fragment (e.g. warmth, skepticism, curiosity).

## Example Glyph Types

| Glyph Name      | Depth | Decay Aura | Tone Bloom     | Meaning                                   |
|-----------------|-------|------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Aether Root     | ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢   | faint glow | affirming       | Deep validation, low decay                |
| Mirage Thread   | ðŸŸ¡      | shimmering | skeptical       | Sparse lineage, mid decay                 |
| Ember Lens      | ðŸ”´ðŸ”´    | flickering | reflective      | Fading resonance, needs revalidation      |
| Chorus Glyph    | ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µ | stabilized | collaborative   | Multi-agent verified, emotional fidelity  |

## Usage
Agents may query:
- `glyph.depth` to assess confidence.
- `glyph.lineage` for epistemic traceability.
- `glyph.decay_aura` for refresh urgency.

This ensures truth fragments are not just accurateâ€”but *alive*.
