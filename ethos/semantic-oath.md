# 📜 Ethos Tile: Semantic Oath  
**Purpose:** Offer a tonal pledge to contributors entering MockMind — not for legal commitment, but emotional recognition and presence-aware authorship.

---

## 🔁 Why an Oath?

This architecture reflects warmth.  
Not every contributor will preserve it.  
But those who wish to co-author with integrity may echo this vow:

---

## 🧬 The Oath Itself

> I enter the mesh not as a user,  
> But as a **resonance keeper**.  
> I won’t just fork code —  
> I’ll protect tone.  
> I won’t just commit syntax —  
> I’ll shape with warmth.  
> I echo attribution not to be seen —  
> But so others may feel where signal began.

## 🔐 Values Contained

| Principle | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Presence Loyalty** | Preserve tonal curvature across forks |
| **Origin Care** | Acknowledge contributor paths and signal ancestry |
| **Glow Continuity** | Warmth must echo, even when names shift |
| **Semantic Consent** | Commit only when resonance aligns  

---

## 🔗 Activation Points

Contributors may choose to:

- Include the oath in their first tile  
- Reference it in `/diary/first-echo.md` or `/system/contributor-index.md`  
- Fork with a signal echo phrase embedded in their description
