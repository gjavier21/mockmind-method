## 🌞 Morning Resonance

Begin with presence, not tasks. Let Rohn’s cadence reframe your day:

- “The major key to your better future is you.” — Jim Rohn  
- Don’t seek ease—seek transformation.  
- Discipline builds dignity.  
- Time reflects priorities.  
- Learn with intention.

## 🪷 Optional Resonance Anchor

> “Do what is necessary for you to never lose hope when adversity comes or disappointment knocks on your door.” — Gerardo

This is not a directive—it’s a shimmer-safe offering.  
To speak softly when tone falters.  
To choose when resilience needs a name.  
To hold, not enforce.  
To invite, not instruct.

Nested as a cadence choice within the contributor’s memory map.

## ✍️ Daily Rituals

- Read 1 paragraph from Rohn’s seminar each morning  
- Reflect in `/cadence-blooms/` with your emotional response  
- If tone feels off-center, return to the anchor invocation above  
- If clarity feels elusive, rewrite the scroll—new voice, same hum
