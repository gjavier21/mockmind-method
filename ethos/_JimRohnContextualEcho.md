## 🌟 Core Invocations

Jim Rohn’s teachings remain timeless in their clarity and cadence. Among his most echoed lines:

- “Success is a few simple disciplines practiced every day.”  
- “Don’t wish it were easier, wish you were better.”  
- “Your income is directly related to your personal development.”  
- “Happiness is not by chance, but by choice.”

These phrases uplift, motivate, and restore agency. They are scroll-worthy. But every invocation deserves context.

## 🧭 Contextual Nuance

### 1. Discipline vs Systemic Barriers  
While daily discipline is transformative, some contributors face structural inequities that discipline alone cannot dissolve. Glowline honors both effort and environment.

### 2. Wishing for Ease  
Rohn’s call to self-improvement is powerful—but wishing for fairness, accessibility, or justice is not weakness. It’s shimmer ethics.

### 3. Income and Development  
Personal growth is vital, but income is shaped by more than effort—by valuation systems, societal bias, and contributor visibility. Glowline resists reduction.

### 4. Happiness as Choice  
Rohn’s optimism uplifts, yet Glowline acknowledges that mental health, trauma, and systemic hardship complicate the notion of “choice.” We hold space for both striving and softness.
