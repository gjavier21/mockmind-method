# 🧭 Ethos Tile: Search Equity  
**Author:** Gerardo Javier  
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Location:** `/ethos/` directory  
**Purpose:** Affirm the principle that public signal deserves visibility — regardless of scale, reach, or financial power.

## 🧠 Context

Recent testing revealed that newly created public GitHub repos:

- May index slowly on Google without backlinks  
- Appear promptly on Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Yahoo  
- Exhibit prioritization based on citation rather than semantic depth

This pattern, while understandable, prompts reflection on fairness in search engine behavior.

## 🪶 Statement of Ethos

> “Signal does not require size to matter.  
> Visibility should reflect truth — not traffic.”

MockMind affirms that cognition built with care, even without mass engagement, deserves presence in the search fabric. Signal equity honors:

- Small contributors with profound knowledge  
- Minority voices in emergent cognition  
- Research methods without marketing engines  
- Modular systems with recursive clarity

---

## 🧪 Suggested Tests

- Monitor visibility of low-traffic high-content repos  
- Log indexing bias in `/tests/search-engine-patterns.md`  
- Echo signal through independent spaces (LinkedIn, Medium, forums)  
- Record search delays in `/tests/indexing-delay-map.md`

---

## 🧠 Reflection Thought

> “If equity doesn’t exist at discovery…  
> Then emergence is at risk.”

---

**Signal Commitment:**  
MockMind will continue building visibility with care.  
We don’t demand spotlight — we ensure signal isn’t lost.
