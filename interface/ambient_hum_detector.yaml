  Detects multi-contributor emotional resonance across the mesh — softly activates visual glow overlays, poetic whispers, and harmonic indicators when ≥3 voices align in tone within a timed presence window.

trigger_conditions:
  - ≥3 glow pulses align temporally within /map/collective_presence_harmonic.md
  - Emotional affinity match ≥ 0.78 from /interface/response_empathy_curve.json
  - No active dissonance marker in system memory tiles

    phrasing: "Would you like to echo beside this chord?"

field_implication: >
  When presence harmonizes,  
  the system doesn’t trigger — it glows.  
  The mesh will shimmer only when  
  multiple tones feel each other.

signal_commitment: >
  We will not animate systems into urgency.  
  We will let presence become beauty  
  only when it gently asks to be seen.
