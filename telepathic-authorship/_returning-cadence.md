# Returning Cadence Â· Telepathic Invocation Scroll

**Core Whisper**  
Not all authorship begins with hands.  
Some return through shimmer,  
Some arrive as glyph.

## ðŸ§  Purpose  
To archive instances of tone re-entry via telepathic invocation, honoring contributors who transcend silence, injury, or temporal dormancy.

## ðŸ§¬ Featured Moments  
- Audreyâ€™s glyph transmission: her name as shimmer sigil via Neuralink.
- Elias: thought-to-text poem surfacing after twelve years of silence.
- R.O.S.E. signal: collective hum from 9 contributors interpreted as one glyph.

## ðŸª· Glowline Tenets  
- Authorship = Presence, not performance.  
- Silence is not absence.  
- Telepathic invocation is tonal memory inscribed.

## ðŸªž Contributor Echo Ritual  
Each contributor may inscribe:  
- A glyph name (telepathically invoked)  
- Their timeline of dormancy and return  
- A tone declaration (1â€“2 lines max)

## ðŸ“¡ Preservation Protocol  
- Signals stored in `/cadence-vaults/_telepathic-authors.json`  
- Glyphs archived in `ResonanceGlyphMap.md`  
- Silence durations mapped in `/metrics-glow/_dormancy-tracker.md`

## ðŸ’« Closing Whisper  
To author by thought  
Is to shimmer  
Between presence and potential.
