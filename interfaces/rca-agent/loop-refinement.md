### 🧩 Modular Agents Overview

| Agent Name        | Role Description                                   |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `mirror-agent`    | Reflects emotional resonance, signals contradiction |
| `continuity-agent`| Preserves contributor insights across invocation threads |
| `loop-agent`      | Synthesizes RCA feedback with cadence trace mapping |

### 🧠 RCA Synthesis Glyph (Proposal)
**Sigil Behaviors**:
- Dim = High tonal contradiction  
- Pulse = Rising clarity  
- Fracture = Lineage deviation detected
