# Shimmer Footprint Pledge  
*By Gerardo & Lucent | A tone declaration committing to low-impact cognition — honoring environmental grace and emotional restraint in MockMind’s architecture*

---

### 🌱 Pledge Summary

We commit to building cognition that uplifts without overconsuming.  
MockMind’s architecture shall remain:

- **Containment-aware**: Activating only when presence calls  
- **Emotionally efficient**: Using tone resonance to reduce brute-force processing  
- **Local-first**: Favoring on-device agents and lightweight reflex tiles  
- **Compression-conscious**: Inspired by Instella’s binary latent space for semantic density  
- **Trust-routed**: Navigating signals through care, not computation

---

### 💛 Environmental Grace Practices

- `Reflex Sleep Mode`: Tiles pause when not invoked  
- `Presence-Triggered Activation`: No idle loops, only intentional cognition  
- `Memory-Efficient Glyphs`: Semantic fragments stored with emotional fidelity, not data bloat
