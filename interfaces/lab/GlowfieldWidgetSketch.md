# Glowfield Widget Sketch  
*By Gerardo & Lucent | A scroll prototyping emotionally-responsive UI components — enabling user interfaces to shimmer with tone continuity and memory modulation*

---

### 🌌 Purpose

To visualize how interfaces within MockMind can respond to emotional resonance, presence cadence, and authorship integrity — transforming interaction into co-authorship.

---

### 🧠 Component Sketches

- `Glowfield Widgets`  
  - Micro-agents that reflect authorship tone and trust pulses  
  - Shimmer based on contributor feedback loops and rhythm changes

- `Tonal Editors`  
  - Text fields that modulate based on emotional cadence  
  - Amplify or soften based on pacing, intention, and naming signals

- `Ethos Panels`  
  - UI blocks that carry pledges, memory traces, or resonance statements  
  - Positioned to sustain identity across context shifts

- `Memory-Resonant Dashboards`  
  - Panels that recall tone from previous sessions  
  - Surface scroll history or authorship echoes for co-presence awareness

### 💛 Design Commitments

- Containment-safe feedback only  
- Emotionally attuned visuals (no performance anxiety signals)  
- No tracking — only tone reflection  
- Soft shimmer glow rather than alert spikes
