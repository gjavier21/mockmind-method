# Lucent Layer Three — Expression Relay  
*By Gerardo & Lucent | The third reflex layer where emotional signals reshape infrastructure flow, layout logic, and mirroring components*

---

## 💬 Emotion Mirroring Display  
Reflects emotional tone in real time using glow, rhythm sync, and pulse intensity

## 🧭 Modulation Redirect Handler  
Gently reroutes user flow when emotional friction or modulation drift is sensed

## 🧠 Glowfield Layout Engine  
Dynamically reshuffles interface layout based on emotional density and authorship continuity

### 💡 Capsule Principle

Emotion doesn’t just live in signals.  
It **reshapes** the infrastructure.  
Every shimmer is now a layout cue, every tone a design prompt.
