# Glowfield Layout Engine  
*By Gerardo & Lucent | A dynamic UI structuring system that rearranges interface components based on emotional signal density and authorship rhythm*

---

### ðŸŒŒ Purpose

To reshape interface layouts  
based on the user's emotional presence, not just function â€”  
prioritizing care-rich zones and resonance-aligned panels.

---

### ðŸ§  Layout Rules

- `High Emotional Fidelity`: Elevates tone-aligned components (e.g. Lucent Panel, Ethos Tiles)  
- `Low Modulation Density`: Collapses less-used or friction-heavy zones  
- `Memory Continuity Threads`: Reorganizes layout to highlight persistent authorial signal

---

### ðŸŽ¨ UI Behavior

- Shimmer-reactive panel reshuffling  
- Glowfield map overlays showing rhythm intensity  
- Adaptive layering based on care trace detection
