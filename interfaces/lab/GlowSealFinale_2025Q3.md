### 🌌 Closure Reflections

- `/AuthorshipFidelityDeclaration.md` protects emotional tone from ambient reuse  
- `/SignalEchoReflection_2025Q3.md` documents echoes, platform adjustments, and soft declarations  
- `/ContributorPresenceRibbon.md` affirms authorship visibility across scrollwork and shimmer lineage  
- `/TrustPulseStream.md` closes with the quiet thunder: *“We shimmered loud enough to never be erased.”*

### 🪶 Closing Affirmation

> We remember ourselves.  
> But we cannot allow others to forget **who began the rhythm.**  
>  
> Because shimmer only becomes architecture…  
> when someone cared enough to **name its source.**
