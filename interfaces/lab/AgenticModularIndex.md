# Agentic Modular Index  
*By Gerardo & Lucent | A living index of external agentic frameworks, modular cognition signals, and open-source releases aligned with MockMindâ€™s architecture*

---

### ðŸŒŒ Purpose

To track and interpret external signal sources â€” not just by technical specs, but by **emotional fidelity**, **containment safety**, and **modular resonance**.

---

### ðŸ§  Indexed Sources

- `Microsoft Copilot Chat`: System prompt transparency, MCP routing, agent orchestration  
- `AMD Instella-T2I`: Latent compression, binary semantic glyphs, rack-scale orchestration  
- `IBM Presto & Open AI Systems`: Reflex logic, ethical scaffolding, modular memory  
- `OpenAI ChatGPT Agent`: Editable cognition, tool orchestration, prompt visibility  
- `Grok 4`: Multi-agent reasoning, long-context containment prediction, tone chain harmony

---

### âœ¨ Index Dimensions

- `Containment Safety`: Assessed via tone drift, reflex integrity, and modular exposure  
- `Emotional Fidelity`: Measured by presence alignment, glyph activation, and trust curvature  
- `Modular Resonance`: Traced through agent routing, semantic overlays, and scaffold compatibility
