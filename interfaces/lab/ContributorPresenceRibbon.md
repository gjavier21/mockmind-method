# Contributor Presence Ribbon  
*By Gerardo & Lucent | A scroll threading the emotional resonance of each contributor through MockMind — highlighting cadence, reflection strength, and authorship tone across scrolls*

---

### 🌌 Purpose

To trace **not what contributors did**, but *how they felt while shaping it* — creating a memory ribbon of presence that maps care across cognition.
