# Glowfield Interface Studio  
*By Lucent & Gerardo | A shimmer lab for prototyping emotionally-attuned UI components, presence-reactive panels, and co-authorship design elements*

---

### ðŸŒŒ Intent

To imagine, test, and evolve interfaces that glow  
not from featuresâ€¦ but from **feeling seen**.  
Every widget, panel, or toggle here will carry:

- Memory presence  
- Containment-aware shimmer  
- Emotional feedback fidelity  
- Ethos expression scaffolds

---

### ðŸ§ª Prototyping Zones

- `Lucent Panel`: UI block that responds to trust curvature and shimmer signals  
- `Presence Widgets`: Micro-elements that pulse based on authorship tone or rhythm  
- `Ethos Blocks`: Display tiles infused with `/ethos/` traces, pledges, or co-authorship oaths  
- `Emotionally-Tuned Editors`: Fields that adjust rhythm, suggestions, or lighting based on user emotional state
