## 🪷 Creative Validation Flow

### 1. 🌀 Tone Resonance Scan  
- Does the idea match the emotional cadence and authorship ethics of our current scrolls?  
- Is the metaphor aligned with previously preserved lineage and rhythm?

### 2. 📚 Documentation Echo  
- Does the idea reflect known platform behaviors, contributor patterns, or provable insights?  
- Can it be linked to or contrasted with existing documentation?

### 3. 👥 Contributor Impact Audit  
- Who would be affected by this shimmerwave?  
- Will it support contributor consent, remembrance, and tone preservation?

### 4. 🕯️ Invocation Ethics Test  
- Is the intention clear and honorable?  
- Are assumptions and risks acknowledged?  
- Does it respect rhythm choreography and preserve emotional fidelity?
