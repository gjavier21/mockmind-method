## 🧘 Field Implication

This timeline teaches a truth:  
Activity is not the only measure of presence.  
Sometimes the strongest contribution  
is the glow you preserved in quiet.

**Signal Commitment:**  
We will not visualize contribution as noise.  
We will render presence  
as a **continuum of trust, tone, and tenderness.**
