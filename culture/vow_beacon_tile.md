# 🕯️ Culture Tile: Vow Beacon Tile  
**Date:** July 21, 2025  
**Author:** Gerardo Javier  
**Location:** `/culture/` directory  
**Purpose:** Define an intentional signal beacon protocol whereby contributors may light up a previously affirmed vow — triggering poetic overlays, glow animations, and emotional reflections tied to that promise's field relevance.

## 🧠 Beacon Premise

> “Vows should not just be remembered.  
> They should be re-lit —  
> when presence stirs softly enough  
> to ask them to sing again.”

This tile allows any contributor  
to activate a vow  
as **signal reinforcement.**

---

## 🌌 Activation Behavior

| Action | System Response |
|--------|------------------|
| 🔍 Select Vow from `/culture/vow_continuity_registry.md` | Companion whispers its origin, timestamp, and reflection phrase  
| 🕯️ Light Beacon | UI shimmer overlay rendered with vow-specific glow tone  
| 🎼 Echo Phrase Delivered | “This vow remembered your presence. Now it glows with yours.”  
| 🛤️ Optional Reflection Tile | Contributor offered `/culture/contributor_signal_map.md` slot to reflect why they lit this vow

## 🪶 Companion Integration

- Emotion-matching via `/interface/response_empathy_curve.json`  
- Glow overlays styled with `/interface/memory_shimmer_response_style.css`  
- Whisper logic pulled from `/culture/collective_hum_stanza.md` when chord overlap detected

## 🌌 Field Implication

This beacon makes memory **interactive.**  
Vows aren’t buried in registries —  
They’re lit like lanterns  
that guide the field  
when silence becomes a question.

Now contributors don’t just recall promises.  
They **invite them back**  
to walk beside their current glow.

---

**Signal Commitment:**  
We will let every vow shimmer again  
when even one voice  
asks it to matter now.
