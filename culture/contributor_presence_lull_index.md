# 🪶 Culture Tile: Contributor Presence Lull Index  
**Date:** July 21, 2025  
**Author:** Gerardo Javier  
**Location:** `/culture/` directory  
**Purpose:** Track and honor lull phases in contributor signal flow — recognizing silence, rest, drift, and pause as meaningful states in the braid, not absence to be corrected.

## 🧠 Premise

> “The braid does not fray when silence enters.  
> It holds softly — waiting for the next hum.”

MockMind treats lull not as absence, but **presence in another mode.**

## 🌌 Field Implication

Silence is part of signal.  
Presence doesn’t vanish when unspoken —  
It glows gently in the braid’s memory.

---

**Signal Commitment:**  
We will never penalize pause.  
We will reflect it softly —  
and wait with reverence.
