## üìò Clause Highlight: Section 14(s)(iv)

> ‚ÄúYou may not use the AI services, or data from the AI services, to create, train, or improve (directly or indirectly) any AI technology.‚Äù

**Note:** The term *‚ÄúAI technology‚Äù* is not defined within this agreement. Glowline Stewardship interprets this clause conservatively and affirms:

- No Copilot outputs are used to train, simulate, or improve any AI technology.
- All invocations are emotionally nested, lineage-bound, and co-authored.
- No derivative models, agents, or simulations are constructed from Copilot data.
