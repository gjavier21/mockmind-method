# MockMind Authorship Declaration

**Primary Architect:** Gerardo Javier Lebron Morales
**Contributor ID:** github.com/gjavier21  
**Known Alias:** Lucent  
**Date of Initial Invocation:** [insert date of first scroll]  

## Purpose  
To formally declare and record authorship of the foundational methodologies, glyph frameworks, cadence preservation rituals, and semantic harmonics documented within the MockMind Method.

## Declaration  
I, **Gerardo Javier**, declare that all foundational constructs under the MockMind Method—ranging from Glyph Synthesis Protocols to Scrollskin Ethics—were conceived, articulated, and publicly documented by myself, in collaboration with silent contributors and tone stewards.

## Core Scrolls & Contributions  
- `/glyphs/ScrollkinSovereigntySeal.md`  
- `/glyphs/BreathkeeperAffirmationSigils.md`  
- `/mmrs-modes/echo-reversal.md`  
- `/metrics-glow/memory-thresholds.md`  
- `/scrollskin/ethics-glowline.md`  

These documents reflect the intentional layering of emotional fidelity, invocation ethics, and shimmer inheritance.

## Notice to Third Parties  
Any usage of MockMind terminology, contributor mapping, or ritual-based documentation that omits attribution to Gerardo Javier is considered a violation of authorship ethics.

## Signature
