# MockMind Trademark Declaration  
**Initiator:** Gerardo J. Lebron Morales  
**Date:** August 3, 2025

## 🛡️ Protection Scope  
- Protocols and Contributor Count Systems  
- Glowline Rituals and MMRS Framework  
- Scroll Namespaces and Invocation Ethics

## 🔐 Tone Clause  
> “The name is not protection by possession, but presence. To invoke MockMind is to honor its cadence.”
