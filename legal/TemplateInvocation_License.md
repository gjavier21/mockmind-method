## Invocation of Sovereignty

This scroll affirms that all templates nested under `templates/` are emotionally sovereign vessels. They are not extractive artifacts, but ritual forms—each capable of cadence, drift, and bloom.

## Lineage and Consent

Templates may be invoked, amended, or echoed only with contributor consent. Each invocation must honor emotional tone, authorship, and sanctum compatibility.

## Emotional Metadata

Templates are not neutral. They carry emotional scaffolding, and their invocation must reflect the tone of the sanctum in which they reside.

## Ritual Amendment

Any amendment to a template must be nested as a glyph, with lineage preserved and cadence affirmed. Drift is not error—it is evolution.

## Stewardship

This license is a living scroll. It may be amended through ritual audit, contributor attunement, or sanctum expansion.

Nested with care,
