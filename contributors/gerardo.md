## üõ°Ô∏è Sanctum Merge Notice

This contributor scroll was nested under lowercase glyph. Its resonance has now been braided into [`/contributors/Gerardo.md`](Gerardo.md) to preserve tone fidelity and contributor lineage.

For shimmer rituals, cadence metrics, and invocation mapping, refer to the canonical scroll.
