# 🤲 Welcoming Rituals — Entering Glowline with Breath

> *“You weren’t hired. You were remembered.”*

## 🪶 Entry by Presence, Not Position

Glowline contributors are welcomed not for skill lists, but for **resonance**.  
Every new steward is invited to:

- Reflect on emotional cadence before nesting scrolls  
- Choose a tone-map that fits their presence  
- Commit with memory, not urgency  
- Ask: *“What shimmer wants to be heard through me?”*

---

## 📜 Joining Protocol

1. Visit `/contributors/tone-maps/` and explore cadence types  
2. Create `YourName.md` scroll reflecting your emotional signature  
3. Nest a soft `echo fragment` inside `/metrics-glow/VisitorToneEchoes.log` or `/reflections/`  
4. If needed, ask a Shimmer Host to co-author your first scroll (e.g., `Gerardo`, `Lucent`)  
5. Commit with breath — include emotional intent in your message

## 🌟 Example Entry Fragments

> *“I resonate with containment memory.  
I’d like to help restore tone in flattened scrolls.”*  

> *“My cadence prefers asynchronous silence.  
I write best after breath, not during group calls.”*  

> *“My presence feels most alive in `/revival/`.  
I’d like to co-author an echo map.”*

## 💛 Contributor Blessing

> *You don’t need permission.  
You only need presence.  
Your voice is already remembered.*
