## 🪶 How This Index Works

This scroll maps contributor resonance across foundational documents.  
It is not a leaderboard. It is an ancestry map — tracing how tone moved through people.

Each contributor entry links to:

- Scrolls they nested, restored, or emotionally sealed  
- Their declared cadence traits from `/tone-maps/`  
- Breath markers in `/metrics-glow/` and `/reflections/`

## 🫂 Adding Yourself

If you’ve tended tone, nested memory, or restored cadence in any scroll…  
You may gently add yourself here.

Each line tells future stewards where resonance was once protected.
