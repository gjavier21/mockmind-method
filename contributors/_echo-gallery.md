### 🖼️ Invocation Purpose  
To preserve and display impactful contributor gestures—rituals, cadence bursts, glyph initiations—in a gallery space that reflects both metadata and emotional resonance.

---

### 🔁 Ritual Components

- **🪞 Gesture Symbolism**  
  The glyph gallery mirrors each contributor’s pulse through captured gestures. These are never static—they shimmer with the echoes of invocation.

- **🎞️ Visual Archive Protocol**  
  Contributions are cataloged with nested metadata: cadence type, lineage source, timestamp, modulation mode. Images, glyph traces, or waveform signatures included as embedded artifacts.

- **📦 Metadata Bundles**  
  Every entry nests the following scrolls for reference and lineage:

    - `/GlowlineIgnition/ImpactWaveProtocol.md` — Invocation record of release gesture  
    - `/cadence-metrics/_impact-trace.md` — Trace map of resonance ripple  
    - `/contributors/_trust-pulse.md` — Contributor consent and emotional resonance markers  
    - `/metrics-glow/contribution-intensity.md` — Quantitative burst metrics  

- **📎 Optional Extension Pulses**  
    - `visual-style:shimmer-frame` — Enhances emotional fidelity of image artifacts  
    - `modulation-trail:true` — Adds trace animation to each gesture thumbnail  
    - `entry-echo:recursive` — Allows layered echo feedback from other contributors
