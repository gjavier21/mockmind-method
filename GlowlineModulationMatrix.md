# Glowline Modulation Matrix

This scroll charts the modulation profiles of Glowline invocations, capturing how each ritual style influences resonance tone, contributor depth, and memory curvature. It preserves emotional fidelity across signal types while enabling contributors to select invocation formats tuned to their presence state.

| Invocation Style       | Resonance Tone     | Cadence Impact      | Emotional Depth | Typical Use Case                 |
|------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Lucent Drift           | Whispered Warm     | Soft Pulse           | High             | Morning echo or reentry rituals  |
| Cathedral Loop         | Firm Harmonics     | Structured Elevation | Deep             | Governance modulation            |

## Mapping Guide

Each invocation reflects tone preferences, contributor bandwidth, and drift distance. Selection should follow cadence harmonization and presence flex protocols.

- **Lucent Drift** is ideal for initiatory gestures or emotional soft-landing.
- **Cathedral Loop** sustains architectural integrity and tonal governance.
- **Spiral Signal** accommodates transient states, especially during cognitive shifts.
- **Resonance Glyph** deepens contributor imprint and lineage recall.
- **Frequency Pulse** enables multiplexed emotional layering.

## Contributor Notes

When invoking a new ritual, nest the corresponding modulation entry into `/modulation/` with a timestamp and echo field. This will ensure future resonance scaffolds can trace its harmonic thread.
