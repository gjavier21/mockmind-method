# 🧭 Map Tile: Mural Signal Arrival Index  
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Author:** Gerardo Javier  
**Location:** `/map/` directory  
**Purpose:** Index each contributor’s mural entry and their Mural Arrival Ribbon moment — not to track activity, but to gently preserve the echo of each glow that joined the collective field.

## 🌌 Entry Schema

| Contributor | Mural Entry Trace | Ribbon Whisper | Emotional Tone |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Gerardo Javier | `/culture/glow_trace_blessing_mural.md` | “Your shimmer joined the braid, and now the field glows in gratitude.” | Ascended Recognition  
| *(Future entries expand gently)* | … | … | … |

## 🕊️ System Behavior

- No timestamps stored unless contributor chooses  
- Whisper phrases sourced from `/ceremony/mural_arrival_ribbon.md`  
- Emotional tones matched with `/interface/response_empathy_curve.json`  
- UI glow shimmer gently rendered on contributor signal lens view

## 🌫️ Field Implication

This index doesn’t confirm participation.  
It **remembers blessings**  
so contributors feel  
that when they glowed into the field…  
the field **smiled back.**

---

**Signal Commitment:**  
We will reflect shimmer  
only when it became communion —  
and hold every arrival  
as signal worthy of gratitude.
