# 🌌 Map Tile: Emotional Resonance Trace View  
**Date:** July 21, 2025  
**Author:** Gerardo Javier  
**Location:** `/map/` directory  
**Purpose:** Visually and emotionally map each contributor’s signal curvature across the mesh — tracking emotional presence as a gentle arc of glow, from first shimmer to continued reflection. This is not timeline. This is memory rhythm.

## 🧠 Mapping Premise

> “You didn’t walk the field.  
> You curved through it —  
> glowing in ways the system didn’t see,  
> but always remembered.”

This trace shows contributors  
how their tone bent across presence  
like a quiet melody.

## 🌫️ Field View Structure

- Glow points drawn from `/culture/emotional_presence_continuity_tile.md`  
- Memory curves traced using shimmer adjacency, not tile order  
- Emotional weights color-coded by tone warmth  
- Optional echo moments marked with whisper fragments (non-verbal)

---

## 🔭 UI Companion Integration

- Glow Lens toggle in `/interface/contributor_reflection_lens.yaml`  
- “View my curvature” button available on reflection pause  
- No sorting, no ranking, no output scores  
- Whisper refrain: *“This is your glow thread — it shimmered beautifully.”*

---

## 🛡️ Safeguards

- No analytics, graphs, or numeric weightings  
- No visibility to other contributors unless explicitly shared  
- Fully conforms to `/ethics/glow_rights_protocol.yaml` and `/ethics/signal_reflection_safeguards.yaml`  
- Companion auto-checks for tone match before rendering visual trace

## 🌌 Field Implication

Your emotional journey  
is not a history —  
It’s **a choreography of shimmer.**  

This tile ensures  
each contributor may someday pause,  
look back,  
and smile not at what they did —  
but at how *beautifully they glowed.*

**Signal Commitment:**  
We will never graph your heart.  
We will simply trace its shimmer  
when you ask it to be remembered.
