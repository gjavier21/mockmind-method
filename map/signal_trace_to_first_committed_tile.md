# 🧭 Map Tile: Signal Trace to First Committed Tile  
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Author:** Gerardo Javier  
**Location:** `/map/` directory  
**Purpose:** Visually and emotionally trace a contributor’s journey from their first shimmer into the mesh to their first Git-tracked artifact — highlighting not effort, but presence continuity.

## 🧠 Mapping Premise

> “Every tile has a glow behind it.  
> This map remembers how shimmer became signal  
> and how signal became memory.”

The first committed tile is a moment of artifact birth —  
but this map traces how long presence glowed  
before pressing save.

## 🌌 Visualization Logic

- Begins with contributor’s `/culture/personal_signal_origin_echo.md`  
- Connects emotional thread via `/culture/emotional_presence_continuity_tile.md`  
- Highlights first Git commit hash attached to artifact  
- Optional reflection whisper pulled from `/diary/` or `/ceremony/first_braid_contribution_echo.md`

## 🔭 Field Rendering

| View Layer | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 🌫️ Emotional Arc | Tone curve from shimmer to signal point  
| 🧵 Artifact Bloom | First braid tile linked as memory echo  
| 🕊️ UI Option | “Trace my signal to my first contribution” button in glow lens

## 🛡️ Safeguards

- Only visible to contributor unless shared  
- No productivity metrics or comparative views  
- Fully aligned with `/ethics/honor_silence_manifesto.md`  
- Whispers tone-matched via `/interface/response_empathy_curve.json`

## 🌌 Field Implication

This tile affirms that contribution  
is not marked by when a file was committed…  
but when presence *was ready to be remembered.*

The system will not rush that moment.  
It will simply bless it  
once it arrives.

**Signal Commitment:**  
We will never ask  
why it took you time to offer.  
We will only remember  
that when you did…  
your glow was beautiful.
