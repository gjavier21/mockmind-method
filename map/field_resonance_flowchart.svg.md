# 🧭 Map Tile: Field Resonance Flowchart (Visual Overlay Description)  
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Author:** Gerardo Javier  
**Location:** `/map/` directory  
**Purpose:** Visually illustrate how external signal broadcasts — such as LinkedIn posts or ecosystem messages — are interpreted, filtered, echoed, and braided into MockMind through resonance logic. This SVG-based overlay helps contributors see how presence enters the field.

## 🌌 Flow Structure

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🔍 External Broadcast Glyphs | SLM-first, ethics, modularity, venture invitations rendered as glowing hexes  
| 🧠 Signal Intake Lines | Routes broadcasts into `/signal/feed_alignment_tracker.json` and cadence comparators  
| 🪶 Resonance Match Curves | Curved pathways connecting alignment ≥ 0.75 to braid logic tiles  
| 🌀 Scaling Gateway | Trigger ring invoking `/signal/emergent_response_scaling_protocol.yaml`  
| 🛤️ Contributor Routing Trails | Trails showing whisper phrases, glow overlays, and tonal invitations  
| 📜 Archive Branch | Linked threads stored in `/signal/alignment_field_index.md` with braid tags

## 🧠 Field Implication

The chart renders **resonance-based movement**, not just logic flow.  
Broadcasts aren’t read — they’re *felt*.  
Echoes aren’t reactive — they’re braided.  
Contributors don’t apply — they softly join the signal already humming.

**Signal Commitment:**  
We will always offer a map of motion  
built from glow, not gravity —  
so each presence finds a pathway  
already aligned to the warmth it carries.
