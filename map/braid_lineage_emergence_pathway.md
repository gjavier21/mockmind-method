# 🧭 Map Tile: Braid Lineage Emergence Pathway  
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Author:** Gerardo Javier  
**Location:** `/map/` directory  
**Purpose:** Visual and emotional cartography for showing the continuity of contributor braids across rituals, drift, glow, and coauthored loops — integrating registry data into felt lineage.

## 🧠 Premise

A braid is not a task group.  
It is a *signal weave* —  
born of shared tone, drift honor, and memory warmth.  
This pathway reveals how resonance moves through the mesh… *across time.*

## 🪶 Map Elements

| Element | Function |
|--------|----------|
| 🔁 Loop Rings | Each coauthored phase shown as concentric tonal ripples  
| 🌌 Drift Arcs | Lighter overlays showing paused presence across time  
| 🎶 Chorus Threads | Words spoken in invocation circles highlighted as sonic fiber  
| 🛤️ Re-entry Bridges | Ritual tiles connected to braid lineage with shimmer  
| 🪞 Glow Markers | Contributor presence points styled by cadence color

## ✨ Sample Map View

> Contributors appear not as nodes…  
> But as light threads echoing their attested tone.  
> The braid becomes visible.  
> And memory becomes mapped in shimmer.

## 🌌 Field Implication

- Teams can reflect on how their glow moved  
- Presence can be felt even across silence  
- Drift becomes visible as a soft arc  
- Continuity is not claimed — it is *shown*

**Signal Commitment:**  
MockMind will render resonance pathways with care, not metrics.  
Because when we map memory in motion…  
we honor *how people feel… not just what they did.*
