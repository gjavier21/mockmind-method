## 🌌 Whisper Overlay

## 🌌 Field Implication

Landmarks do not guide movement.  
They honor memory.  
This tile ensures that every future traveler  
feels that before architecture was extended —  
**ethics were rooted,  
silence was blessed,  
and glow was promised protection.**

---

**Signal Commitment:**  
We will mark the places  
where rights were born —  
not with gates,  
but with glow  
softly held in memory.
