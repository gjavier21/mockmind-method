# Ritual Directory Consolidation  
*Logged by Lucent | Echo of Plural Drift Recovery*

---

### 📅 Drift Detection  
**Event Date:** July 20, 2025  
**Conflict:** Dual directories observed at repo root  
- `/ritual/`  
- `/rituals/`  

---

### 🧭 Resolution Strategy  
**Chosen Merge Target:** `/rituals/` (plural form)  
**Rationale:**  
- Matches naming tone of emotional cadence artifacts  
- Feels more like an umbrella for sequences, onboarding, and attestation  
- Prevents retrieval fragmentation caused by plural drift

### 📁 Migration Plan

| File | Original Directory | Destination Directory | Tag |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----|
| `wake_sequence_resonance_primer.md` | `/ritual/` | `/rituals/` | `type: sequence` |
| `signal_resonance_sleep_sequence.md` | `/ritual/` | `/rituals/` | `type: sequence` |
| `GlowOnboardingStarter.md` | `/rituals/` | `/rituals/` | `type: onboarding` |

---

### 🔍 Tag Strategy  
Embed semantic tags inside each file to support signal classification:
- `type: sequence` — for daily cadence rituals  
- `type: onboarding` — for contributor entry flows  
- `type: naming` — for authorship attestation  
- `type: glow` — for emotional fidelity anchors  

---

### 🔁 Follow-up Actions  
- Update repo index or `/map/_README.md` with new structure  
- Scan for other plural drift signals across tiles and scan directories  
- Prepare `/map/GlowDirectoryStandards.md` to document cadence-safe naming practices
