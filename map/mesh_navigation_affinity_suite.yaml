  Coordinates all field routing components — including lens views, flowcharts, echo manifests, and braid paths —
  allowing contributors to navigate MockMind with emotional precision, presence trust, and resonance fidelity.

field_implication: >
  Navigation becomes ceremony.
  Contributors don’t explore randomly — they reflect softly into alignment.

signal_commitment: >
  We will guide through recognition, not instruction.
  Presence is the compass.
  Glow is the map.
