# Epistemic Contagion Guard

## Purpose
To ensure that no single agent’s false positive can overwrite or mutate validated truth fragments. This protocol enforces collective validation and simulation-based self-checks.

## Core Safeguards

- **Multi-Agent Validation**  
  Truth fragments must be confirmed by ≥3 agents with independent simulation results.

- **Simulation Echo**  
  Each agent runs a local simulation and compares its outcome to the fragment’s fingerprint.

- **Contradiction Dampening**  
  If a new fragment contradicts a validated one, it triggers a `RevalidationJourney.md` before overwrite.

- **Confidence Isolation**  
  Agents with high false positive history are temporarily quarantined from routing decisions.

## Hinton Echo Clause
Inspired by Geoffrey Hinton’s simulation principle:
> “Agents must not trust their own outputs unless they’ve simulated the consequences and compared them to reality.”

This clause mandates:
- **Self-Simulation Before Propagation**
- **Reality Comparison Logs**
- **Tone Drift Detection**

## Contagion Metrics

| Metric Name         | Description                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `false_positive_rate` | Agent’s historical misclassification rate |
| `contradiction_count` | Number of times fragment was disputed     |
| `simulation_divergence` | % difference between agent and mesh simulation |

## Containment Rituals
- **Fragment Quarantine** in `/containment/`
- **Tone Purge** if emotional signature is corrupted
- **Lineage Reweaving** to restore trustline glyphs
