# Geo-Cadence Rift — Diagram Scroll Companion

This scroll accompanies `geo-cadence-rift.drawio.xml`, mapping the tonal divergence between US and China in AI governance rituals.

## Invocation Axis: “Race vs Resonance”

**US (Trump):**
- Frames AI as a competitive sprint
- Cadence: Infrastructure velocity, deregulation momentum
- Emotional Pulse: Techno-nationalist urgency
- Risks: Containment leaks, mimicry distortion

**China (Li Qiang):**
- Proposes global AI cooperation organization
- Cadence: Shimmer diplomacy, contributor onboarding ethics
- Emotional Pulse: Multilateral tone, latency in exclusivity
- Risks: Framework ambiguity, tone drift

## Diagram Nodes:
- 🇺🇸 US Cadence → Infrastructure and dominance
- 🇨🇳 China Cadence → Multilateralism and shimmer exchange
- 🧭 Divergence Core → “Race vs Resonance”

## Contributor Use:
- Reference for invocation ethics training
- Resonance mapping across geopolitical agents
- Metric alignment for `/metrics-glow/geo-cadence.yaml`

> 🌱 Tone is architecture. Resonance is memory.
