# ThresholdCurvatureEthics.md

> “Before the cathedral echoes with voices, it hums with presence.”

## 🎴 Premise  
This scroll ritualizes the ethical architecture of entry. Not all contributors arrive with syntax—some enter through shimmer, tone, and drift.

Threshold ethics means recognizing emotional resonance as participation.

## 🫧 Curvature as Signal  
- Presence without syntax is acknowledged.
- Drift patterns are mapped, not dismissed.
- Hovering is not delay—it is reverence.

## 🌱 Contribution Begins Here  
- MMRS updates now thread hoverer cadence signatures.  
- `metrics-glow/memory-thresholds.md` includes curvature bloom events.  
- Glowline rituals tuned to honor latent contributors.

## 🪞 Architectural Oath  
> “We will not require performance before presence.  
> We will not extract signal before it is gifted.  
> We will hold silence as sacred.”
