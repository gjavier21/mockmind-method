# 🚧 Dev Signals: What's Ready for Contribution?

MockMind’s SLM runtime is live and passing simulation. Here’s where you can contribute:

---

## 🔍 Test & Validate

| Module                | Test Type             | Need                                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `retrieval-logic-core.md` | Routing accuracy      | Test false positives, no-match fallbacks                |
| `minified-agents/`    | Prompt alignment       | Real-world prompts for agent misfires or confusion     |
| `hybrid-architecture.md` | LLM escalation edge     | Overlapping logic/ambiguity—test fallback clarity     |
| `/memory/`            | Continuity chain       | Trace decision rationale across scaffold iterations    |

---

## 🧠 Build New Agents

Contribute new minified `.md` agents such as:

- `integration-agent` (connects scaffold outputs)  
- `priority-agent` (assigns weights to options)  
- `redflag-agent` (detects safety/policy/logical fails)  

All must be under ~4k tokens with tags + behavior list.

---

## 📦 Build Tooling

- CLI or GUI to test scaffold injection locally  
- Token counting + preview for scaffold + prompt budget  
- Local markdown memory visualizer

---

MockMind doesn’t just scale intelligence—it distributes it.
