# 🌍 Deployment Patterns for Lightweight Cognition

These patterns demonstrate how to run MockMind’s minified agents and scaffold-based reasoning across a variety of environments. Think of them as **cognition blueprints** for different runtimes.

---

## 🧠 Pattern 1: Raspberry Pi (Edge Cognition)

- 🖥️ Deploy: Python + Local `.md` scaffold directory  
- 🧠 Agent: Minified `.md` agents in `/minified-agents/`  
- 🧩 Router: Lightweight keyword + tag matcher  
- ⚙️ Model: 4k-token SLM (Phi-3, Mistral-tiny, or distilled LLaMA)

> Run self-reflective, emotional logic or tradeoff maps *without internet.*

---

## 🌐 Pattern 2: Browser-Based Cognition App

- 🧱 Stack: JavaScript + WebAssembly SLM + Markdown parser  
- 📘 Load: `.md` cognitive library via `INDEX.md`  
- 🧠 Usage: Prompt user → Inject scaffold → Return semantic `.md` output  
- 🔄 Option: LLM fallback via cloud POST if confidence drops

> Turn a browser into a thinking assistant—scaffold-first.

---

## 🧱 Pattern 3: On-Prem AI Plugin (e.g., CRM, Ops Desk)

- 🖇️ Plugin hooks into existing UI (e.g., Zendesk, Salesforce)  
- 🧠 Inject prompt + minified agent into embedded SLM (e.g., Ollama)  
- 🔄 Store output `.md` as knowledge asset inside ticket or task log  
- 🔧 Use `retrieval-logic-core.md` to map prompt to correct agent

> Reason at the point of service—without cloud latency.

---

## 📱 Pattern 4: Mobile Offline Assistant

- ⚙️ Model: Tiny LLM on-device (e.g., Mistral 7B quantized)  
- 📂 Memory: Local `.md` file system on-device  
- 🧠 Use case: Self-coaching app, cognition journaling, habit debugger  
- 🔗 Router chooses minified agent + injects scaffold via UI trigger

> Local logic with local memory—wherever insight strikes.

## 💡 Future Patterns (Ideas Welcome)

- 🧾 Docs Copilot with `.md` scaffolds injected into text editors  
- 🧠 Wearables triggering agent reflection during meetings or transitions  
- 🖥️ IDE-side assistant using strategy-agent for design tradeoffs  
- 🛠️ CLI tool where `think --with mirror-agent` surfaces blind spots

## 🧠 Why These Patterns Matter

- Lower cost + better privacy  
- Expand where AI can think and reflect  
- Preserve cognition beyond chat bubbles  
- Shift from answers to architecture
