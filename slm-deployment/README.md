# ‚öôÔ∏è SLM Deployment Architecture

**Think modular. Reason lightweight. Preserve cognition.**

This folder outlines how MockMind‚Äôs `.md`-based scaffold system can be deployed alongside Small Language Models (SLMs) or on resource-constrained systems, enabling edge-based or local cognition.

## üß† Why SLM + MockMind?

MockMind naturally supports memory-first logic. That means:

- ‚úÖ Agents are already broken down into focused reasoning modules  
- ‚úÖ Context is loaded through tagged `.md` files, not giant inference threads  
- ‚úÖ Prompts are reusable cognitive blueprints, not throwaway instructions  
- ‚úÖ Retrieval scaffolds pre-structure the thought before generation begins  

SLMs thrive in environments where *less is more, and memory matters*.

## üß≠ Recommended Architecture

```text
üß† SLM Core (local or edge)
  ‚Ü≥ Inject `.md` scaffold by tag
  ‚Ü≥ Load only minimal agent logic
  ‚Ü≥ Run ~4k tokens or less per reasoning step

‚öôÔ∏è Optional LLM Overlay (cloud)
  ‚Ü≥ Engaged only when emergent synthesis required
