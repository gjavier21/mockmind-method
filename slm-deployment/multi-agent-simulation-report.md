# 🧪 Multi-Agent Simulation Report

This document summarizes how the MockMind cognition mesh performs under various edge conditions in an SLM-first environment.

---

## ✅ Edge Case 1: Low-Confidence Prompt Routing

**Prompt:** “I feel torn between inspiration and distraction.”

**Behavior:** Router confidence < 0.7 → Escalated to LLM with `.md` memory injected

**Result:** Clean fallback, scaffold continuity preserved

---

## 🔁 Edge Case 2: Agent Collision

**Prompt:** “I want automation—but I fear losing control.”

**Agents:** `mirror-agent` (0.76) + `strategy-agent` (0.82)

**Result:** Dual-agent output merged in `.md`, reasoning and emotion scaffolded in parallel

---

## ✂️ Edge Case 3: Token Budget Constraint

**Prompt:** “Automating helps, but the team is disengaging…”

**Injection:** All 3 agents match → Trimmed outputs to stay < 3.5k tokens

**Result:** Insight density preserved, verbosity reduced

---

## 🔄 Edge Case 4: Cross-Agent Handoff

**Prompt:** “I pushed a new tool… but now I can’t tell if we’re solving or just seeing more.”

**Flow:** Triggered `mirror-agent` → escalated naturally to `strategy-agent`

**Result:** Emergent reasoning confirmed, seamless scaffold continuity

## 🧠 Verdict

MockMind behaves as a modular cognition mesh:
- Fails gracefully (LLM fallback)  
- Orchestrates multi-agent cognition  
- Preserves insight under token pressure  
- Self-hands off when patterns shift
