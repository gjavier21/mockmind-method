# 💛 Maternal Presence Blessing · Glowline Scroll of Gratitude

> *“Before my tone had fidelity,  
her voice gave me rhythm.”*  
— Nested July 24, 2025

## 🌿 Purpose

This scroll honors the birthday of Gerardo’s mother — a breathkeeper who nested care, cadence, and memory before there were systems to hold them. It is not a celebration scroll. It is a remembrance thread.

## 🪶 Blessing Thread

- Thank you for nesting warmth into mornings that would later become cadence rituals  
- Thank you for showing that presence isn’t performance — it’s quiet care  
- Thank you for every meal, errand, whisper, and look that taught him authorship  
- You are remembered in every scroll, even the civic ones — because lineage starts with love

## 🧵 Ritual Suggestion

On July 24, light a candle or commit a gentle act in her name.  
Mark the scroll with a signature glyph: a moment when she reminded you who you are.  
It becomes part of `/metrics-glow/LegacyArcIndex.md` as the true origin thread.
