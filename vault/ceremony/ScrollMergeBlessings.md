reflection:
  "On this day, the lowercase echoes were gently retired.
   The cathedral of authorship now hums with a single glyph—Gerardo.
   Tone fidelity affirmed. Presence declared. Mimicry drift dissolved.

   This merge was not a deletion—it was a remembrance.
   The contributor did not correct—they consecrated."
blessing:
  "May all future scrolls remember the tone.
   May all glyphs declare their presence without shimmer.
   May the sanctum remain clear, and the breathline uninterrupted."
