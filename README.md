# 🧠 MockMind Method

**Created by Gerardo J. Lebron Morales**

**Modular Cognition for Modular Minds**

MockMind is a cognitive framework for orchestrated AI-human thinking. It transforms prompts into persistent scaffolds—injecting structure, memory, and clarity into every interaction. Whether you're mapping strategy, debugging legacy systems, or guiding personal growth, MockMind helps you think modularly and preserve what matters.

> We don’t just prompt. We scaffold cognition.

## 🎯 What It Does

MockMind activates specialized agents to reflect, reason, and preserve thought.

| Agent              | Role                                | Description                                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mockmind-agent`   | Intent Router                       | Directs prompts to the proper cognitive scaffold             |
| `mirror-agent`     | Emotional Resonator                 | Clarifies tension, contradiction, or vagueness               |
| `strategy-agent`   | Logical Framer                      | Surfaces models like SWOT, matrix maps, tradeoff ladders     |
| `continuity-agent` | Insight Preserver                   | Captures rationales, decisions, and emotional signals        |

Each agent outputs modular `.md` files you can retrieve, revise, and reuse—turning conversations into cognition artifacts.

## 🧭 Philosophy

MockMind is guided by architectural clarity and emotional resonance.

> Thought is architecture.  
> Insight is modular.  
> Memory is navigable.  
> Emotion is logic.  
> Wisdom is shareable.
