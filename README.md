# MockMind Method

**Created by Gerardo J. Lebron Morales**

MockMind is a cognitive framework for ambient prompt recall, designed to reduce iteration cycles, preserve user wisdom, and accelerate AI-human collaboration. It enables Copilot-style assistants to recognize successful prompt structures and inject them mid-conversation—flattening complexity and expanding cognition for all users.

## 🌟 Vision

> *"No great prompt should be lost—and no great idea should begin from scratch."*

MockMind transforms static mock files into a reusable scaffold for intelligence. Whether you're building enterprise systems, crafting educational flows, or mapping strategy, this method helps AI recall your success and replicate it system-wide.
