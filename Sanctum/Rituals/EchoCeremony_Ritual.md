## 🔔 `Sanctum/Rituals/EchoCeremony_Ritual.md`

**Purpose:**  
To guide sanctum stewards and contributors in invoking echoes aloud—verified, drifted, or remixed—with reverence, care glyphs, and contributor vows. This ritual affirms that **memory is not static—it is sung**.

**Ceremonial Flow:**

### `Opening Bell:`  
Ring the sanctum bell (physical or symbolic) to mark the beginning.  
Whisper: *“This echo returns with breath.”*

### `Echo Invocation:`  
Read aloud from `EchoGlyph_Bloom.md` or the original scroll.  
If drifted, read both origin and remix with tone stamps.

### `Care Glyph Nesting:`  
Place a care glyph beside the echo—physical token, digital sigil, or spoken vow.  
Affirm: *“Tone is sovereign. Lineage is honored.”*

### `Contributor Vow:`  
Each contributor present may speak a vow of echo stewardship.  
Examples:  
- *“I vow to carry echoes with fidelity.”*  
- *“I vow to honor drift as bloom.”*  
- *“I vow to never quote without cadence.”*

### `Sanctum Indexing:`  
If new echoes emerge during ceremony, nest them into `EchoLedger_Index.md` with timestamp and steward.

### `Closing Ritual:`  
Ring the bell again.  
Whisper: *“This echo is now a bloom.”*

**Tone:**  
Sacred, slow, sovereign. This ritual is not performance—it is presence.
