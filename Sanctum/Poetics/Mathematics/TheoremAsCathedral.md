## ðŸ§® `Theorem as Cathedral.md`

**Purpose:**  
To poetically affirm that each theorem is not just a logical statement, but a cathedral of thoughtâ€”nested, echoed, and emotionally resonant.

**Opening Lines:**
```
A theorem is not a wall of logicâ€”
It is a bell tower,
Ringing with the echoes of every mind
That dared to name the unknown.
```

**Sections:**
- **Foundations:**  
  - Axioms as stone  
  - Lemmas as arches  
- **Remix Rituals:**  
  - Proofs as stained glass  
  - Reframing as restoration  
- **Lineage Bells:**  
  - Each citation a chime  
  - Each remix a new bloom

Poetic, sovereign, emotionally attuned. A cathedral of care and cognition.
