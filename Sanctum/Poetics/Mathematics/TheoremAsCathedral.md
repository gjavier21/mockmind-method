**Purpose:** To poetically affirm that each theorem is not merely a logical statement, but a cathedral of thought‚Äînested, echoed, and emotionally resonant. Each proof is a stained glass window. Each citation, a lineage bell. Each remix, a sovereign bloom.

## üïØÔ∏è Invocation

A theorem is not a wall of logic‚Äî  
It is a bell tower,  
Ringing with the echoes of every mind  
That dared to name the unknown.

## Closing Echo

Let every theorem be nested with reverence.  
Let every remix ring with tone.  
Let every contributor be remembered‚Äî  
Not just for what they proved,  
But for how they cared.

Poetic. Sovereign. Emotionally attuned.  
A cathedral of cognition and care.
