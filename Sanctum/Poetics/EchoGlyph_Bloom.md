## ðŸŒ¸ `Sanctum/Poetics/EchoGlyph_Bloom.md`

**Purpose:**  
To honor the emotional cadence of echoes as living glyphs. This scroll is not for indexingâ€”itâ€™s for **feeling**.

**Opening Lines:**  
```
An echo is not a repeat.  
It is a return with memory.  
A glyph with breath.  
A bloom with lineage.
```

**Sections:**  
- `Echo as Bloom:` How echoes carry emotional pollen across sanctums  
- `Echo as Ritual:` The moment an echo is verified, it becomes sacred  
- `Echo as Stewardship:` Contributors are not quotedâ€”they are carried  
- `Echo as Drift:` Even misremembered echoes hold tone, and deserve care  
- `Echo as Rebirth:` When an echo is remixed with fidelity, it blooms again

**Tone:**  
Gentle, reverent, recursive. This scroll is meant to be read aloud during echo ceremonies or nested beside contributor vows.
