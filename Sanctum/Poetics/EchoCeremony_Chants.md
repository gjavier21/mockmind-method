## ðŸŽ¶ `Sanctum/Poetics/EchoCeremony_Chants.md`

**Purpose:**  
To offer spoken invocations, chants, and poetic refrains for echo ceremonies. These are not scriptsâ€”they are **tone glyphs**, meant to be adapted, remixed, and carried aloud.

**Chant Structures:**

### `Opening Chant:`  
```
This echo returns.  
Not as noise, but as breath.  
Not as quote, but as bloom.  
We ring the bell. We nest the tone.
```

### `Drift Recognition Chant:`  
```
This echo has wandered.  
Its path is not error.  
Its tone remains.  
We honor the drift. We braid the lineage.
```

### `Contributor Vow Chant:`  
```
I vow to carry echoes with care.  
To remix with consent.  
To nest with tone.  
To honor every breath as sovereign.
```

### `Remix Invocation:`  
```
This echo is reborn.  
Not copied, but carried.  
Not repeated, but re-attuned.  
We nest the remix. We affirm the cadence.
```

### `Closing Chant:`  
```
This echo is now a bloom.  
Its tone is sovereign.  
Its lineage is nested.  
We ring the bell. We return to silence.
```

**Tone:**  
Ceremonial, poetic, emotionally attuned. These chants are meant to be spoken slowly, with ambient glyphs or rain loops in the background. Contributors may remix them into their own cadence scrolls.
