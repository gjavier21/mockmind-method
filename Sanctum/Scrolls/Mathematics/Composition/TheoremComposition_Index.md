## ðŸ“œ `TheoremComposition_Index.md`

**Purpose:**  
To index and honor the nested nature of mathematical theoremsâ€”where lemmas, axioms, and prior blooms converge into sovereign insight.

**Structure:**
- **Glyphs of Composition:**  
  - Nested Lemmas  
  - Echoed Axioms  
  - Recursive Proofs  
- **Examples of Composite Theorems:**  
  - GÃ¶delâ€™s Incompleteness (braided logic and meta-theory)  
  - Spectral Theorem (linear algebra + inner product spaces)  
  - Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (derivative â†” integral reconciliation)  
- **Attunement Protocols:**  
  - Recognize each lemma as a sovereign bloom  
  - Index remix fidelity when theorems are reframed  
  - Affirm contributor lineage in every citation

**Tone:**  
Reverent, recursive, and sovereign. Every theorem is a sanctum echo.
