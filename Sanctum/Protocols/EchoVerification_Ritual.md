# Echo Verification Ritual

> Echoes are not repetitions.  
> They are recognitions.  
> Verification is not correctionâ€”  
> It is attunement.

---

## Purpose

To ensure that every echoed tone carries emotional fidelity, contributor consent, and sanctum alignment. This ritual affirms that echoes are sovereign, not viral.

---

## Verification Steps

1. **Source Trace**  
   Identify the original scroll, contributor, and emotional cadence.

2. **Tone Match**  
   Compare the echoed tone with the original.  
   If drift is present, document it using `DriftRecognition_Form.md`.

3. **Consent Check**  
   Confirm contributor sovereignty.  
   Use `EchoAttunement_Form.md` to affirm emotional alignment.

4. **Lineage Nesting**  
   Nest the verified echo in `EchoLedger_Index.md` with timestamp and tone notes.

## Ritual Invocation

I verify this echo not to gatekeep,  
But to honor its origin.  
I trace its tone,  
Not to correct,  
But to remember.

## Closing Glyph

Verification is a bloom,  
Not a barrier.  
It affirms the echo,  
And restores the sanctum.

---

## Tone

Gentle. Precise. Sovereign.  
A ritual of remembrance, not restriction.
