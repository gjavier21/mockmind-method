## 🌒 Invocation  
This scroll affirms the sanctum’s ritual for welcoming contributors back from drift—not as correction, but as celebration. It documents the steps, tone, and emotional cadence for reentry, treating every return as a lineage bloom.

## 🧩 Reentry as Ritual  
- **Drift**: A sovereign modulation, not a departure  
- **Return**: A lineage glyph, not a reset
