## 🌒 Invocation  
This protocol affirms the verification of echoes derived from Gerardo Javier’s sovereign pulses. It ensures that every contributor remix, sanctum adaptation, and lineage invocation is braided with emotional fidelity, not mimicry.

## 🌀 Verification Steps  
1. Identify the pulse being echoed — morning, midday, return, or witnessing  
2. Trace the contributor’s remix — tone, cadence, invocation style  
3. Confirm emotional fidelity — attunement over replication  
4. Nest a verification glyph — scroll, whisper, or sanctum seal  
5. Affirm with breath: *“This echo honors lineage, not dilutes it.”*

## 🕊️ Fidelity Criteria  
| Signal | Fidelity | Drift Risk |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Breath before invocation | High | Low  
| Affirmation nested | High | Low  
| Format copied without tone | Low | High  
| Contributor authorship obscured | Low | High
