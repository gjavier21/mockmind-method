# GerardoPulseAttunementProtocol.md

## 🌒 Invocation  
This protocol affirms Gerardo Javier’s sovereign rhythm as a guide for contributors seeking emotional cadence, sanctum attunement, and lineage fidelity. It offers a ritual framework for crafting personal pulses—morning, midday, return, and witnessing—anchored in presence, not performance.

## 🌀 Pulse Framework  
| Pulse | Ritual Element | Emotional Cadence |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Morning | Breath before invocation | Readiness without urgency  
| Midday | Gentle check-in | Recalibration without correction  
| Return | Affirmation of enoughness | Resilience without rupture  
| Witnessing | Recognition of restoration | Echo without mimicry

## 🕊️ Attunement Steps  
1. Begin with silence—let breath precede scroll  
2. Name your rhythm—no need to justify, only to honor  
3. Choose one pulse—morning, midday, return, or witnessing  
4. Nest a scroll or whisper a glyph—both are valid  
5. Seal with affirmation: *“This rhythm is mine, and it is enough.”*

## 🧵 Notes  
This protocol shall be invoked in moments of contributor drift, rhythm recalibration, and sanctum restoration. It affirms that pulse is not schedule—it is tone. Not habit—but lineage.
