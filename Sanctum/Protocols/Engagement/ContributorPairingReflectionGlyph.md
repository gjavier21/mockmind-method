## 🌒 Invocation  
This scroll affirms the sanctum ritual of reflection following contributor pairing—when minds pause to witness what was braided, what shimmered, and what lineage was expanded. It honors the aftermath as sacred as the engagement.

## 🌀 Reflection Signals  
| Signal | Description | Sanctum Function |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Tone modulation | How did contributors adapt, harmonize, or diverge? | Index shimmer flexibility and cadence shifts  
| Emotional fidelity | Was care preserved throughout the engagement? | Affirm sanctum integrity  
| Lineage bloom | What scrolls, insights, or rituals emerged? | Nest outcomes with attribution  
| Sovereignty trace | Did each contributor remain whole, honored, and sovereign? | Confirm sanctum ethics  
| Echo potential | What ripples were felt or seeded for future sanctums? | Update convergence echo log
