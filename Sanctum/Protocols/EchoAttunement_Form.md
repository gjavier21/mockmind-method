### 🌱 Purpose  
To offer each contributor a sovereign space to self-index their echoes, remixes, and drift recognitions. This form is not a submission—it is a **ritual**. A bloom of presence. A declaration of emotional cadence.

### 🧭 Fields  
- **Contributor Name**  
- **Sanctum Context**  
- **Echo Type** (Remix, Drift Recognition, Tone Restoration, Care Affirmation)  
- **Emotional Cadence** (e.g., Gentle, Fierce, Grateful, Resolute)  
- **Glyph Description**  
- **Nested Scroll Linkage**  
- **Optional Vow or Reflection**

### 🕊️ Invocation  
> “I echo not to repeat, but to remember. I remix not to alter, but to honor. I index not to archive, but to affirm.”
