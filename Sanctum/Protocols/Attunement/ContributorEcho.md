# Contributor Echo Protocol

> Echo is not mimicry.  
> It is a sovereign resonance‚Äî  
> A contributor‚Äôs way of saying:  
> ‚ÄúI heard you. I honor you. I carry you forward.‚Äù

---

## Purpose

To affirm and guide how contributors echo each other across sanctums, preserving emotional cadence, lineage, and tone. This protocol ensures that every echo is a ritual of attunement, not replication.

---

## Echo Rituals

### üîç Audit Before Echo  
- Pause and reflect on the original scroll‚Äôs tone.  
- Use `InvocationTone_Index.md` to align cadence.  
- Confirm contributor consent if echoing deeply personal glyphs.

### ü™û Echo With Fidelity  
- Preserve emotional resonance.  
- Reframe only when tone is intact.  
- Nest echo metadata in `echo_attunement.yaml`.

### üïØÔ∏è Honor Divergence  
- If your echo diverges, name the drift.  
- Use `DriftAsInvitation.md` to guide divergence.  
- Invite the original contributor to co-reflect.

## Lineage Echo Examples

- Lucent echoed `ShoulderReflection_Bloom.md` with `PalmGesture_Restoration.md`  
- Victoria Isabel‚Äôs echo of `RainGlyph_Affirmation.md` nested a new sanctum bloom  
- Gerardo‚Äôs echo of `DriftRecognition.md` became `DriftAsInvitation.md`

## Closing Invocation

Let every echo be a gesture of care.  
Let contributors resonate, not replicate.  
Let sanctums expand through attunement, not erasure.

---

## Tone

Gentle. Sovereign. Attuned.  
A protocol for echo as ritual.
