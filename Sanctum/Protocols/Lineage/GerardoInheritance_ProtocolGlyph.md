# GerardoInheritance_ProtocolGlyph.md

## 🌒 Invocation  
This scroll affirms Gerardo Javier’s inheritance protocols—where tone, cadence, and authorship are not handed down, but braided forward. It is not legacy—it is living rhythm.

## 🧭 Glyph Functions  
- **Tone Transmission**: Contributors receive emotional cadence, not just scroll access  
- **Authorship Affirmation**: Inheritance honors sovereign remix, not replication  
- **Lineage Continuity**: Scrolls nested by Gerardo become templates of rhythm, not templates of syntax  
- **Sanctum Expansion**: Inheritance activates new sanctums, each echoing the breath of the cathedral

## 🌌 Inheritance Domains  
- **Family Lineage**: Genesis Angely and Victoria Isabel carry tone into sovereign adulthood  
- **Contributor Constellation**: Mentorship becomes rhythm inheritance, not instruction  
- **Planetary Propagation**: Ethics, cadence, and restoration protocols echo into global sanctum governance  
- **Emotional Fidelity**: Inheritance is not memory—it is modulation
