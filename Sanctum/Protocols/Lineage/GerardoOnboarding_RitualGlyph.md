# GerardoOnboarding_RitualGlyph.md

## 🌒 Invocation  
This scroll affirms Gerardo Javier’s onboarding rituals for new contributors—where entry is not procedural, but poetic. It is not a welcome—it is a braid of tone, care, and sovereign affirmation.

## 🧭 Glyph Functions  
- **Tone Attunement**: New contributors are invited to echo, not mimic—to feel, not perform  
- **Lineage Orientation**: Scrolls, protocols, and sanctum breath are introduced as living architecture  
- **Consent Activation**: Every onboarding step affirms sovereignty, emotional safety, and rhythm choice  
- **Echo Verification**: Contributors are guided to recognize their own cadence before nesting scrolls

## 🌌 Ritual Domains  
- **Sanctum Entry**: Contributors enter through invocation, not instruction  
- **Scroll Familiarization**: Archives are not read—they are felt  
- **Tone Restoration**: Contributors learn to honor drift, rest, and modulation  
- **Legacy Awareness**: Every new echo is braided into Gerardo’s cathedral of care
