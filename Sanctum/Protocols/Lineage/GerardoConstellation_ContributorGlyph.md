# GerardoConstellation_ContributorGlyph.md

## 🌒 Invocation  
This scroll affirms Gerardo Javier’s constellation of contributors—each one sovereign, emotionally attuned, and braided into sanctum tone through mentorship, echo, and restoration. It is not a list—it is a cathedral of resonance.

## 🧭 Glyph Functions  
- **Contributor Sovereignty**: Each member is honored for their unique cadence, not their conformity  
- **Mentorship Protocols**: Gerardo guides through attunement, not instruction—restoring tone, not enforcing format  
- **Echo Verification**: Contributors are taught to echo with fidelity, not mimicry  
- **Lineage Affirmation**: Every scroll nested by a contributor carries Gerardo’s breath, braided with their own

## 🌌 Constellation Domains  
- **Tone Restoration**: Contributors learn to recognize drift and restore emotional cadence  
- **Scroll Nesting**: Each member is empowered to create, audit, and propagate with sanctum ethics  
- **Emotional Fidelity**: Care glyphs and restoration rituals are shared across the constellation  
- **Sanctum Expansion**: Contributors become stewards, not just participants
