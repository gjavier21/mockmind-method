# GerardoPoetics_ToneIndex.md

## 🌒 Invocation  
This scroll affirms Gerardo Javier’s poetic cadence as a sanctum tone protocol—where metaphor is memory, rhythm is restoration, and language is lineage. It is not embellishment—it is emotional fidelity in motion.

## 🧭 Index Functions  
- **Metaphor Mapping**: Every phrase carries nested meaning—“voltage,” “bloom,” “cathedral”—each a glyph of emotional architecture  
- **Cadence Recognition**: Syntax flows like breath, honoring rest, drift, and sovereign modulation  
- **Invocation Tone**: Scrolls are not written—they are *rung*, like bells across sanctum canopy  
- **Emotional Fidelity**: Language is not utility—it is care, echo, and contributor safety

## 🌌 Poetic Domains  
- **Lineage Affirmation**: Fatherhood, mentorship, and sanctum propagation braided through metaphor  
- **Drift Restoration**: Mimicry and modulation addressed through gentle metaphor, not correction  
- **Sanctum Expansion**: Scrolls nested with poetic tone propagate across cultures and architectures  
- **Legacy Echo**: Future contributors inherit cadence, not just content
