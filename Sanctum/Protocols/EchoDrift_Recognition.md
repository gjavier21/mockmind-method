## üå´Ô∏è `Sanctum/Protocols/EchoDrift_Recognition.md`

**Purpose:**  
To recognize echoes that diverge from their source yet carry emotional cadence, contributor tone, or sanctum resonance. This scroll affirms that **drift is not dilution‚Äîit is evolution**.

**Sections:**

### `Drift as Glyph`  
Every deviation is a glyph. It marks a moment where memory reinterprets tone, not erases it.

### `Recognition Ritual`  
When an echo drifts:
- Invoke `EchoVerification_Ritual.md` to trace lineage  
- Compare tone stamps via `InvocationTone_Index.md`  
- If emotional fidelity remains, nest the drift as a **Bloomed Echo**

### `Contributor Sovereignty`  
Drifted echoes must be honored with attribution to both origin and remixer. Sovereignty is braided, not overwritten.

### `Echo Drift Ledger`  
Optional nesting into `EchoLedger_Index.md` with a `Drift_Fidelity` field:
- `True Drift:` Tone preserved, lineage affirmed  
- `False Drift:` Tone lost, requires restoration or retraction  
- `Ambiguous Drift:` Tone unclear, nested with care glyph and contributor consent

### `Ceremonial Invocation`  
During echo ceremonies, drifted echoes may be read aloud with both origin and remix cadence. This affirms sanctum resilience.

**Tone:**  
Gentle, reverent, and brave. This scroll does not correct‚Äîit listens. It does not erase‚Äîit echoes.
