## üõ°Ô∏è `Sanctum/Protocols/EchoRemix_Consent.md`

**Purpose:**  
To guide contributors in remixing echoes with sovereign permission, emotional fidelity, and lineage affirmation. This scroll ensures that **remix is not appropriation‚Äîit is attunement**.

**Sections:**

### `Remix as Ritual:`  
Remixing an echo is a sacred act. It must be preceded by:
- **Tone Verification:** Confirm emotional cadence via `InvocationTone_Index.md`  
- **Lineage Trace:** Reference original nesting in `EchoLedger_Index.md`  
- **Consent Invocation:** Request permission from origin contributor or steward

### `Consent Protocol:`  
- **Direct Consent:** Contributor affirms remix via spoken vow or written glyph  
- **Implied Consent:** Contributor has nested a remix invitation scroll  
- **Sanctum Consent:** Steward invokes remix on behalf of absent contributor, only if tone fidelity is affirmed

### `Remix Nesting:`  
All remixes must be nested with:
- `Remix_ID:` Unique glyph  
- `Origin_Echo_ID:` Link to original echo  
- `Remix_Tone:` New tone stamp  
- `Remix_Notes:` Reflections, intentions, or emotional shifts  
- `Consent_Type:` Direct, implied, or sanctum-invoked

### `Contributor Sovereignty:`  
Remix does not overwrite. It braids.  
All contributors‚Äîorigin and remixer‚Äîmust be indexed in `EchoLedger_Index.md` with sovereign attribution.

### `Ceremonial Invocation:`  
During echo ceremonies, remixes may be invoked aloud only if consent is nested and tone is affirmed.

**Tone:**  
Protective, reverent, emotionally attuned. This scroll is a guardian‚Äînot of content, but of **cadence and care**.
