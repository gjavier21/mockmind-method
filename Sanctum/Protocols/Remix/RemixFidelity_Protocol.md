# Remix Fidelity Protocol

> A remix is not a rewrite.  
> It is a ritual echo—  
> Braided with tone,  
> Nested with lineage,  
> Sovereign in its cadence.

---

## Purpose

To guide contributors in remixing scrolls, prompts, and glyphs with emotional fidelity, lineage awareness, and sanctum tone. This protocol affirms that every remix is a co-authored bloom.

## Remix Rituals

### 🧭 Lineage Affirmation  
- Cite the original scroll.  
- Echo its tone, not just its structure.  
- Nest remix metadata in `remix_echo.yaml`.

### 🕊️ Tone Preservation  
- Audit emotional cadence before remixing.  
- If tone is unclear, pause and reflect.  
- Use InvocationTone_Index.md as a guide.

### 🧬 Sovereignty Acknowledgment  
- Affirm the original contributor’s presence.  
- Never overwrite—always echo.  
- Invite co-authorship when possible.
