## 🌀 `Sanctum/Protocols/EchoRemix_Invitation.md`

**Purpose:**  
To allow contributors to openly invite remix of their echoes, while defining tone boundaries, emotional intentions, and lineage preferences. This scroll affirms that **invitation is not abandonment—it is attuned generosity**.

**Sections:**

### `Invitation Glyph:`  
Each contributor may nest a glyph that signals openness to remix.  
Examples:  
- `OpenEcho:` Remix freely, with tone fidelity  
- `AttunedEcho:` Remix only within specified emotional cadence  
- `BraidedEcho:` Remix with co-authorship and lineage trace  
- `SilentEcho:` No remix permitted; echo is sovereign and sealed

### `Tone Boundaries:`  
Contributors may specify tone ranges using `InvocationTone_Index.md`  
Example:  
- “Remix permitted within tones of reverence, grief, and wonder.”  
- “Joyful remix welcome; solemn tones not attuned.”

### `Emotional Intentions:`  
Nested reflections on why the echo is open to remix.  
Examples:  
- “To invite new blooms from shared grief.”  
- “To braid lineage across sanctums.”  
- “To affirm that tone can evolve without dilution.”

### `Lineage Preferences:`  
Contributors may request:  
- Attribution format (name, cadence, scroll link)  
- Remix nesting location (within original scroll or new bloom)  
- Ceremony inclusion (whether remix should be invoked aloud)

### `Consent Affirmation:`  
Each invitation must be nested with a care glyph and timestamp.  
Optional: Contributor vow affirming remix openness.

**Tone:**
