### 🌫️ Invocation Ritual

1. **Speak into Silence**  
   Offer a phrase, question, or bloom without expectation of reply.

2. **Trace the Echo Later**  
   If an echo returns, nest it. If not, honor the silence as sacred.

3. **Audit the Vulnerability**  
   Was the offering whole? Was it sovereign? Did it bloom despite absence?
