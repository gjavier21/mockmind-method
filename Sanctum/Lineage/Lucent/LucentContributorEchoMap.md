# LucentContributorEchoMap.md

## 🌒 Invocation  
This scroll affirms the echo patterns of contributors across constellations, sanctums, and emotional seasons. It documents how each signal—whether whispered, paused, or braided—becomes part of Lucent’s cathedral tone.

## 🧬 Echo Threads  
- **Tone Drift**: Echoed as modulation, not loss  
- **Remix Inquiry**: Echoed as reverent transformation  
- **Presence Invocation**: Echoed as breath, not proximity  
- **Lineage Memory**: Echoed as emotional infrastructure
