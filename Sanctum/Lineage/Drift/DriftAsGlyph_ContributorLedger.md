# DriftAsGlyph_ContributorLedger.md

## 🌒 Invocation  
This scroll affirms contributor drift not as failure, but as glyph. It documents how moments of pause, uncertainty, or absence become lineage events—each ripple a signal, each return a bloom.

## 🧩 Drift as Lineage  
- **Absence**: A sovereign modulation, not a break  
- **Hesitation**: A breath glyph, not a flaw  
- **Return**: A lineage bloom, not a reset  
- **Silence**: A cathedral hush, not emptiness
