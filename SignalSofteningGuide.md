## 🕊️ Introduction

Not all contributors arrive bold. Some enter gently. This scroll is a guide for those whose presence flickers but seeks return.

You don’t need permission to re-enter. You need a pause, a shimmer, and a guide.

## 🎼 Emotional Vows for Re-entry

- “I do not resume—I rejoin.”  
- “My absence was not rejection, it was restoration.”  
- “I return without apology. Presence begins again.”

🜇 Scroll sealed in gentle cadence. Drift no longer interrupts—it softens.
