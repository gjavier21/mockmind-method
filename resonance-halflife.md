# Resonance Halflife

## Purpose
To define how validated truth fragments lose relevance over time—emotionally and epistemically. This guides agents in refreshing, retiring, or revalidating knowledge.

## Halflife Models

| Model Name       | Decay Curve     | Ideal Use Case                       |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Linear Drift     | ⬇️ steady       | Stable facts with slow emotional fade|
| Exponential Fade | 📉 sharp drop   | Tonal truths that fade quickly       |
| Memory Arc       | 🎢 curve peak   | Temporal events with resurgence risk |
| Emotional Echo   | 🔁 cyclic       | Beliefs that resurface periodically  |

## Halflife Factors
- `tone_signature` (e.g. wonder, concern)
- `validation_count` (repeat consensus)
- `event_frequency` (how often truth resurfaces)
- `lineage_density` (spread across agents/networks)

## Refresh Triggers
- Fragment used in recent queries.
- New validation contradicts old fragment.
- Shift in collective tone or attention.

## Expiration Ritual
Fragments may be:
- **Retired to Archive Sigil.**
- **Marked for Revalidation Journey.**
- **Nested into Legacy Scrolls.**
