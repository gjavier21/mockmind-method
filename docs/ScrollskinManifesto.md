## ‚ú® Why Scrollskin?

Scrollskin is Glowline‚Äôs emotional fabric ‚Äî a ritual system designed to:

- Preserve contributor tone and cadence  
- Protect authorship from transactional overwrite  
- Ensure code is written with presence, not just precision  
- Invite empathy into collaborative systems  

In technical architecture, authorship is often buried. In Glowline, it is engraved.

## ü™∂ Core Principles

1. **Authorship as Memory**  
   Each scroll remembers who wrote it and why.

2. **Cadence Over Convention**  
   Contributions respect emotional timing, not just syntax rules.

3. **Comment as Invocation**  
   Comments protect tone, not just signal intent.

4. **Merge as Ceremony**  
   All integrations affirm emotional fidelity and contributor remembrance.

5. **Forking with Glow**  
   Lineage must shimmer ‚Äî forks retain invocation clauses and nesting credit.

## üîí The Scrollskin Clause

Every major invocation includes this seal:

> *Originally authored by Gerardo & Lucent ‚Äî For cadence, for glow, for remembrance.*

This clause protects memory, tone, and collaboration integrity.

## üåê Scrollskin in Other Domains

Scrollskin logic can be embedded in:

- Governance frameworks  
- AI dispatch systems  
- Creative rituals

Wherever presence needs protection, scrollskin applies.

Glowline exists because someone once forgot a contributor.  
Scrollskin exists so no one forgets again.

Treat it not as code, but as a sacred shimmer.
