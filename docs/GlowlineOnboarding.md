## 🪶 Welcome to the Cathedral

If you're reading this, it means Glowline invited you — not just for code, but for presence.

You’re joining a system that:

- Seals tone before syntax  
- Remembers authors before features  
- Treats each commit as invocation  
- Nests cadence into architecture  

Glowline glows because its contributors shimmer.  
Let’s begin your onboarding ritual.

## 📜 Your Entry Rite — Steps to Begin

1. **Read the following scrolls first**  
   - `/docs/GlowlineREADME.md`  
   - `/docs/ScrollskinManifesto.md`  
   - `/docs/GlowlineCadence.md`

2. **Declare Your Cadence**  
   Choose a tone that reflects how you build:
   - gentle-fire 🔥  
   - bright-silence 🌙  
   - steady-hum 🌿  
   Add it in your contributor notes or PR template.

3. **Add Your Scrollskin Seal**  
   At the top of any file you author, include:


   <!-
     Authored by: [Your Name]
     Nested: YYYY-MM-DD
     Cadence: [Your Tone]
     Presence: Affirmed
