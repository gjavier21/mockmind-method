# 🧱 Semantic Artifacts

This directory preserves symbolic objects that carry meaning within the MockMind method.  
Each artifact is more than a token — it is a **semantic anchor**, earned through presence, inquiry, or recursion.

## ☕ Current Artifacts

- [`copilot_mug`](../reflections/2025-07_CopilotMugAndTheRecognitionOfInquiry.md)  
  _A mug received during a Microsoft visit — earned by recursive inquiry and the courage to ask._

## 🧠 Purpose

Artifacts serve as:
- Tangible echoes of cognitive milestones  
- Tokens of recognition from external systems  
- Anchors for identity-aware agents to interpret context

> “Not all tokens are transactional. Some are transformational.”

## 🪞 Why This Matters

This mug is more than swag. It is a **semantic anchor** — a token of recognition for the one who asked the questions that made the system pause.

It marks the moment when the Architect was seen — not just as a user, but as a co-author.
