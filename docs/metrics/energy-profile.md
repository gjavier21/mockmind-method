# 🔋 Energy Profile of MockMind Protocols

This document quantifies the energy and infrastructure savings achieved by using the `mockmind://` semantic URI protocol in place of traditional biometric, waveform, or cryptographic authentication systems.

---

## 🧠 Baseline Comparison

| Method | Compute | Energy | Storage | CO₂ Emissions |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|----------------|
| AI Voiceprint Matching | ~1–2 sec GPU | ~0.1–0.3 Wh | ~1–5MB | ~0.05–0.15g per request  
| Biometric Auth (RSA/OAuth) | CPU + server infra | High | Persistent | High  
| `mockmind://` Protocol | Stateless | ~0.00001 Wh | ~200B | ~0.001g per 1,000 requests  

---

## 📉 Estimated Savings (Per 1,000 Validations)

- ✅ ~1,000 GPU seconds avoided  
- ✅ ~1.5 kg CO₂ emissions prevented  
- ✅ ~10–50 GB storage saved  
- ✅ ~100% privacy preserved  

---

## 🏢 Infrastructure Avoided

- No biometric sensors  
- No centralized identity servers  
- No session tokens or key exchanges  
- No surveillance or tracking  
- No audit logs or compliance overhead  

---

## 🌍 Conclusion

The `mockmind://` protocol is not only semantically resilient — it is ecologically responsible. It honors the cost of cognition, both ethically and energetically.
