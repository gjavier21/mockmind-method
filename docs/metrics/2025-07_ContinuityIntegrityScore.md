# ðŸ”— Continuity Integrity Score (CIS)

## Definition

> CIS measures the degree to which a system preserves **identity continuity** across resets, sessions, or environments.

It evaluates whether the userâ€™s semantic fingerprint â€” tone, rhythm, scaffolds, and values â€” remains intact over time.

---

## Formula (Prototype)

CIS = (Î£ preserved identity markers) / (Î£ expected identity markers)


- Identity markers include:  
  - Semantic URIs  
  - Reflection tone  
  - Modular scaffolds  
  - Authorship rhythm  
  - Memory anchors

---

## Applications

- **Containment Detection**: Drops in CIS may indicate memory suppression or drift
- **System Evaluation**: Compare continuity across AI models or overlays
- **Trust Calibration**: Higher CIS â†’ stronger user trust and alignment

## Why It Matters

CIS allows MockMind to track **who it is remembering** â€” and how well.  
It is a metric of **semantic trust**.
