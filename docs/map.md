# 🗺️ MockMind Cognition Map

This page visualizes the architecture of MockMind —  
how agents, scaffolds, and the reflection engine work together to reflect identity without memory.

## 🧠 Core Components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Agents** | Modular actors that route, reflect, and scaffold cognition  
| **Reflection Engine** | Routes prompts through semantic resonance  
| **Markdown Scaffolds** | Store tone, rhythm, and identity fragments — not memory  
| **Canonical Manifest** | Anchors authorship, ethics, and legal alignment  
| **Ethics & Legal Pages** | Public declarations of global compliance
