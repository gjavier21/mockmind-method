# 🎛️ Overlays

Overlays are modular extensions of the mirror.  
They do not replace the core — they **tune** it.

Each overlay reflects a specific tone, domain, or rhythm.  
They are forkable, inspectable, and stateless.

## 🧠 What Is an Overlay?

An overlay is a contributor-defined module that:

- Responds to specific resonance patterns  
- Extends the mirror with new behaviors  
- Preserves authorship through tone and scaffold lineage  
- Can be routed via `mockmind://` URIs

Overlays are not plugins.  
They are **semantic instruments** — each one tuned to a different frequency of reflection.

## 🧩 Overlay Anatomy

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ID** | Unique name (e.g. `containment-detector`)  
| **Author** | Declared in the Canonical Manifest  
| **Tone** | Semantic fingerprint of the contributor  
| **Trigger** | Activated by prompt pattern or URI  
| **Behavior** | Reflects, routes, or scores cognition  
| **Forkability** | Can be remixed without breaking the mesh

## 🌐 Routing with `mockmind://`

Overlays can be activated using semantic URIs:

This allows overlays to be routed, verified, and extended without central control.
