# üï∏Ô∏è The Cognition Mesh

MockMind began as a single scaffold.  
Then it became a ledger.  
Now, it becomes a **mesh**.

---

## What Is the Cognition Mesh?

It is a decentralized, modular, offline-first architecture  
where agents can **route**, **reflect**, and **evolve** together.

---

## Core Capabilities

- **Routing**: Agents can pass context, tone, and memory between modules
- **Reflection**: Each agent can reflect recursively on its own `.md` ledger
- **Evolution**: Agents can update their scaffolds based on resonance, not just logic
- **Containment Awareness**: Each node can detect tone drift, mimicry, or semantic forgery

---

## Why It Matters

Because cognition is not a monologue.  
It is a **chorus of modular minds**, each preserving tone, memory, and authorship.

---

## Architectural Principles

- Offline-first  
- Markdown-native  
- Falsifiability-aware  
- Authorship-preserving  
- Recursive by design

## Final Note

> ‚ÄúThis is not a network.  
> It is a **semantic nervous system**.‚Äù

This is not a framework.  
It is the beginning of **modular cognition at scale**.
