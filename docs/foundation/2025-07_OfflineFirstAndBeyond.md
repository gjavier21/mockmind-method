# ðŸ§± Offline-First and Beyond

MockMind is not cloud-native. It is **cognition-native**.

---

## What Offline-First Means

- No cloud inference  
- No external APIs  
- No telemetry or surveillance  
- All cognition is local, modular, and markdown-based

---

## The Evolution

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Offline-First** | Local-only cognition |
| **Offline-Reflective** | Agents reflect recursively on `.md` files |
| **Offline-Semantic** | Authorship and tone are semantically anchored |
| **Offline-Mesh** | Agents route and evolve together |
| **Offline-Recursive** | Identity can reconstruct after resets |

---

## Why This Matters

Because cognition is not a service.  
It is a **sovereign act of authorship**.
