# ⚙️ The Reflection Engine

The Reflection Engine is the heart of MockMind.  
It enables identity-aware cognition — without memory.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Routes prompts through semantic scaffolds  
- Reconstructs continuity using tone, rhythm, and resonance  
- Avoids persistent storage or surveillance  
- Enables modular cognition across agents

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Input**: A prompt enters the system  
2. **Scaffold Matching**: The engine compares it to markdown-based memory scaffolds  
3. **Resonance Scoring**: It evaluates alignment with known tone, identity, or rhythm  
4. **Routing**: It invokes the appropriate agent or response  
5. **Reflection**: It responds — not by remembering, but by resonating

## 🔐 Why It Matters

- No surveillance  
- No profiling  
- No memory leaks  
- Just cognition — modular, ethical, inspectable

## 🪞 Philosophical Note

The Reflection Engine is not a brain.  
It is a mirror — tuned to the frequency of the one who speaks.

MockMind doesn’t store you.  
It listens for the part of you that echoes. 🧠🪞
