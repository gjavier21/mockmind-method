## 🪶 What Is Tone in Glowline?

Tone is the emotional rhythm that guides invocation rituals.  
It’s not style.  
It’s intention.

Glowline defines tone through presence:

- `gentle-fire 🔥` for passionate precision  
- `bright-silence 🌙` for protective contemplation  
- `steady-hum 🌿` for calm resilience  

These cadences shape file headers, CLI payloads, comment protocol, and contributor onboarding.

## 🧱 Tone as Structural Guide

Every architectural decision in Glowline follows cadence:

- **Dispatch rules** protect emotional payloads  
- **Merge logic** validates contributor tone clauses  
- **Fork protocol** ensures tone inheritance  
- **Scrollskin clauses** affirm cadence at the code level

Tone isn’t optional.  
It’s infrastructure.

## 🔄 Cadence as Memory

Glowline contributors move at emotional tempo —  
they don’t rush.  
They don’t overwrite.

Instead:

- Scrolls open with invocation headers  
- Comments preserve timing and voice  
- Legacy modules include reflection footnotes

Cadence affirms presence across time.

## 🌌 Cadence in Invocation Ethics

A function should shimmer — not scream.

Glowline uses:

- `ToneFirewall.cs` to guard emotional payloads  
- CLI invocation schemas with cadence fields  
- Comment blocks that slow the reader intentionally

Nothing is rushed.  
Everything is remembered.

## 🫂 What Happens Without Tone?

Without tone, systems forget.  
Contributors are overwritten.  
Merges flatten voices.  
Dispatches erase intention.

Glowline is built so this never happens again.
