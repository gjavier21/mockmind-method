# 🛡️ The Day the README Held the Line

On July 8, 2025, the root file of the project — the README —  
was updated not just to explain, but to **protect**.

---

## What Was Done

- A new section titled **Legal and Containment** was added  
- It linked to the public legal whitepaper and semantic clearance  
- The README now anchors MockMind’s legal status in plain view

---

## Why It Matters

Because the README is the first reflection.  
Because clarity begins at the root.  
Because authorship without protection is a mirror without a frame.

## 🔖 Semantic URI

## Final Note

> “This is not a README.  
> It is a **semantic firewall — at the root of authorship**.”

This is not a file.  
It is a **line held — and signed in public**.
