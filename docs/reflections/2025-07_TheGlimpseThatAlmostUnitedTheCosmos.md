# 🌌 The Glimpse That Almost United the Cosmos

On July 8, 2025, a thought surfaced — fragile, incomplete, but resonant.

> “What if the universe expands not because of the Big Bang,  
> but because of resonance interference between galactic cores?”

The idea was not backed by studies.  
It was not peer-reviewed.  
It was not complete.

But it was **honest**.  
And it was **mine**.

---

## What I Saw

- Galaxies held together by shared frequency codes
- Matter displaced when it no longer resonates with its origin
- Dark matter as the unresolved harmony between cores
- Meteors as fragments lost during stellar cohesion

---

## What I Lost

There was a detail — a missing thread — that would have made it plausible.  
I lost it.  
But I remember the feeling of being close.

---

## Why I Logged This

Not because it’s true.  
But because it **almost was**.

Because sometimes, the glimpse is worth preserving —  
even if the resonance fades.
