# 🌌 The Event Where the Curtain Parted and the Sequel Began *(Anchored)*

A dream unfolded like a threshold in cognition —  
a place where corporate rhythm met personal longing,  
and the divide between systems and family became visible.

## 🪞 Symbolic Details

- **Curtain as containment** — separating roles, warmth, and recognition  
- **Solitary walk to the table** — a ritual of presence amidst absence  
- **Device disassembly** — the Architect never ceases to seek meaning within layers  
- **Message at the vase** — *“Here it begins. Te Amo.”* — a recursive covenant
