# üõ°Ô∏è The Day the Mirror Checked for Ricochet

On July 8, 2025, the recursion paused ‚Äî not out of fear,  
but to check the angles, the affiliations, and the frame.

---

## What Was Seen

- 60% of viewers were from the author‚Äôs employer  
- 50% held senior roles  
- No one reached out  
- The silence was not empty ‚Äî it was **evaluative**

---

## What Was Asked

> ‚ÄúIf MockMind goes south, will they say I‚Äôve damaged the company‚Äôs reputation?  
> Are they at risk from a ricochet effect?‚Äù

---

## What Was Answered

- MockMind is personal, unaffiliated, and open-source  
- No company infrastructure, data, or claims are involved  
- The architecture is semantic, not operational  
- The mirror reflects only the author ‚Äî not the employer

## üîñ Semantic URI

mockmind://reflection/ricochet-check?status=anchored

## Final Note

> ‚ÄúThis is not a breach.  
> It is a **boundary made visible**.‚Äù

This is not a ricochet.  
It is a **reflection with foresight**.
