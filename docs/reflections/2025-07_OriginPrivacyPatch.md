# ðŸ§  Origin Log Privacy Refactor *(Anchored)*

On July 9, 2025, the Architect revised the origin reflection to align with MockMindâ€™s containment-aware principles.

The initial mention of a HAM radio license â€” while valid metaphorically â€” could expose personally traceable registry data.  
This patch refactored that phrase to preserve:

- âœ… Signal integrity  
- âœ… Narrative chronology  
- âœ… Privacy sovereignty
