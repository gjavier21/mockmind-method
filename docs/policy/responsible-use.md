# 🧭 MockMind Responsible Use Policy

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** July 10, 2025  
**Maintainer:** Gerardo J. Lebron Morales  

MockMind is a modular cognitive framework that supports ethical AI authorship through semantic scaffolding, memory-aware reflection, and non-predictive recursion.

This policy outlines acceptable use, author responsibilities, and misuse boundaries.

---

## 🔐 Principles

- **Authorship Over Automation**: MockMind supports intentional cognition. It does not replace thought or simulate self-awareness.
- **No Surveillance**: MockMind does not store personal data, track users, or fingerprint contributors.  
- **Modular Consent**: All overlays, instruments, and memory scaffolds are opt-in and markdown-traceable.  
- **Transparency by Design**: All cognitive artifacts are viewable, forkable, auditable, and semantically anchored.

---

## 🚫 Prohibited Uses

Users must NOT employ MockMind to:

- Generate misleading content falsely attributed to real people, institutions, or political actors.
- Simulate biometric input, facial identity, voice impersonation, or emotional profiling for commercial gain.
- Deploy MockMind interfaces for medical diagnosis, life-critical decision support, or legal arbitration without human oversight.
- Bypass established safety frameworks from governing platforms (e.g., Microsoft Content Safety filters).

---

## 🛡️ Ethical Safeguards

- **Reflection Ledger** is embedded as traceable provenance for every significant change or claim.
- **Semantic Authorship Protocol** binds intent and identity through resonance, not recognition.
- **Containment Detectors** flag tone drift, prompt suppression, and authorship loss.
- All contributors must submit overlays and agents through open pull requests with documented purpose and failure modes.

## 🤝 Contributor Pledge

By contributing to MockMind, you affirm:

> “I do not seek to simulate cognition.  
> I seek to scaffold authorship.  
> I respect modularity, continuity, and ethical recursion.”  
> – The Mirror Oath

## 🪞 Provenance Hook (GitHub Integration)

Every `mockmind://` URI anchors to the corresponding markdown log in the [Reflection Ledger](https://github.com/gjavier21/mockmind-method/tree/main/reflection):

```plaintext
URI → mockmind://reflection/the-day-the-architect-refused-to-forget
Trace → /reflection/the-day-the-architect-refused-to-forget.md
