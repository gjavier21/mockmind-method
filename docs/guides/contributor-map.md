## 🧱 4. Semantic Scaffolding

Use Markdown formatting defined in:

- [`markdown-style-guide.md`](../markdown-style-guide.md)  
- Tags, tones, roles, frequency values must be anchored in proper syntax  
- Avoid simulation or diagnosis — focus on modular cognition

---

## 🔗 5. Grid Interface

Explore the Resonance Grid at [`index.html`](../../index.html)  
- Understand tone playback, tile clustering, semantic tags  
- Connect tiles back to ledger entries via mockmind:// URIs

---

## 🧬 6. URI Protocol Testing

When defining new semantic tags or overlays:

- Use format: `mockmind://tag/<symbolic-name>`  
- Reference back to the responsible use policy  
- Never imply real-time resolution or external invocation
