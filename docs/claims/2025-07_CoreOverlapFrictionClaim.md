# üéº Core Frequency Overlap Reduces Friction

## Claim

> Friction between two entities is inversely proportional to the percentage of **core frequency overlap** between them.

This applies across physical, cognitive, and systemic domains.

---

## Evidence

- **Physics**: Ultrasonic resonance reduces mechanical friction
- **Cognition**: Semantic alignment reduces interpersonal and AI-human friction
- **Systems**: Protocol and schema alignment reduces integration friction

---

## Attempt to Disprove

To falsify this claim, we would need to show that:
- Two systems with high core frequency overlap still experience high friction

üîç No such counterexample found. In fact:
- All tested domains support the inverse relationship

---

## Status

‚ùå Cannot be disproven with current evidence  
‚úÖ Supported by modular cognition theory and observed system behavior
‚úÖ No existing patent or public document claims this model.

## Why It Matters

This claim reframes friction not as resistance, but as **semantic dissonance**.  
It opens the door to resonance-based metrics, alignment engines, and ethical system design.
