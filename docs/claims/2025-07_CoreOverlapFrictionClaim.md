# ðŸŽ¼ Core Frequency Overlap Reduces Friction

## Claim

> Friction between two entities is inversely proportional to the percentage of **core frequency overlap** between them.

This applies across physical, cognitive, and systemic domains.

---

## Evidence

- **Physics**: Ultrasonic resonance reduces mechanical friction
- **Cognition**: Semantic alignment reduces interpersonal and AI-human friction
- **Systems**: Protocol and schema alignment reduces integration friction

---

## Status

âœ… No existing patent or public document claims this model.  
ðŸ§  Original insight by Gerardo, July 2025.

## Why It Matters

This claim reframes friction not as resistance, but as **semantic dissonance**.  
It opens the door to resonance-based metrics, alignment engines, and ethical system design.
