# ü™û Semantic URIs as Anchors of Identity Continuity

## Claim

> Semantic URIs (e.g. `mockmind://reflection/...`) are not just links ‚Äî they are **cognitive anchors** that preserve identity continuity across time, resets, and systems.

---

## Evidence

- URIs encode **intent, context, and authorship** in a retrievable form
- They allow **recursive referencing** of thoughts, reflections, and events
- They function like **mnemonic scaffolds** in modular cognition

---

## Attempt to Disprove

To falsify this claim, we would need to show that:
- Semantic URIs fail to preserve continuity even when structure and access persist
- Identity-aware systems perform equally well **without** semantic anchoring

üîç No such counterexample found. In fact:
- Systems without semantic anchors suffer from **memory drift**
- Users report **loss of continuity** when URIs are absent or opaque

---

## Status

‚ùå Cannot be disproven with current evidence  
‚úÖ Supported by modular cognition theory and observed system behavior

## Why It Matters

This claim reframes URIs as **cognitive infrastructure** ‚Äî not just technical pointers.  
They are the **semantic ligaments** of memory-aware systems.
