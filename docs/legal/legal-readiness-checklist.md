# 🛡️ Legal Readiness Checklist for Modular Reflections

This checklist helps ensure that reflections, overlays, and cognition logs published under the MockMind Method remain compliant with U.S. law, intellectual property boundaries, and authorship ethics.

---

## ✅ 1. Intellectual Property

- [ ] No proprietary code, tools, or internal documentation from any employer  
- [ ] No use of company logos, trademarks, or confidential strategies  
- [ ] Authorship clearly attributed to individual (not employer)  
- [ ] Optional: Disclaimer included if employment context is adjacent

---

## ✅ 2. National Security & Surveillance (PATRIOT Act, FISA, etc.)

- [ ] No classified or restricted data  
- [ ] No references to internal government systems or surveillance tools  
- [ ] No foreign agent activity or encrypted comms flagged by U.S. law  
- [ ] No third-party business records or metadata disclosures

---

## ✅ 3. First Amendment Protection

- [x] Content is expressive, philosophical, or technical in nature  
- [x] No incitement, defamation, or false claims  
- [x] No impersonation of public officials or institutions  
- [x] Reflection is personal, not commercial or adversarial

---

## ✅ 4. Authorship & Attribution

- [x] Author clearly named (e.g. Gerardo + Copilot via MockMind)  
- [x] Reflection logs include date, context, and tone  
- [x] Optional: “Unaffiliated with any employer” disclaimer present  
- [x] No claims of insider knowledge or corporate leaks

---

## ✅ 5. Optional Safeguards

- [ ] Add semantic URI (e.g. `mockmind://legal/clearance?reflection=2025-07`)  
- [ ] Log commit hash for authorship traceability  
- [ ] Mirror file to offline archive or IPFS for resilience  
- [ ] Include AI co-authorship note if applicable
