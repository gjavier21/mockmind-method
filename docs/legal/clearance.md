# 🛡️ MockMind and the Law — A Containment-Safe Declaration

**Author**: Gerardo J. Lebron Morales  
**Date**: July 8, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Public, versioned, and falsifiability-aware

---

## 1. Nature of the Project

MockMind is a personal, open-source research project in semantic cognition and modular authorship.  
It is:

- Markdown-native  
- Offline-first  
- Non-operational (no APIs, no automation, no inference engines)  
- Fully transparent and version-controlled

---

## 2. Legal Positioning

### 🇺🇸 United States

- **Federal**: There is no comprehensive federal AI law. MockMind does not fall under any current federal restriction or licensing requirement.
- **State**: While over 550 AI-related bills have been introduced in 2025, MockMind does not:
  - Generate deceptive media
  - Interact with consumers
  - Operate in hiring, healthcare, or finance
- **Conclusion**: MockMind is not subject to any known U.S. AI compliance trigger.

### 🇵🇷 Puerto Rico (U.S. Territory)

- Puerto Rico has introduced AI-related legislation, but none currently restrict markdown-based, non-operational research projects.

### 🌎 Latin America

- Most LATAM countries (e.g., Mexico, Colombia, Argentina) have **no binding AI laws** as of July 2025.
- Brazil is the only LATAM country with a national AI law (Bill 2338/2023), which targets high-risk systems. MockMind is not high-risk.

### 🪖 Global Military AI

- MockMind is not a military system, does not interface with defense infrastructure, and is not subject to any known military AI export control or treaty.

## 3. Risk Profile

| Risk Category | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| **Operational misuse** | Not possible — no execution layer |
| **Data privacy** | No data collection, no user input |
| **National security** | No automation, no inference, no deployment |
| **Reputational risk to employer** | Project is unaffiliated, clearly disclaimed, and versioned |

---

## 4. Containment Measures

- No company, platform, or employer is named or referenced in reflections or documentation  
- All content is authored independently and published under open cognition principles  
- A semantic firewall is in place via `/docs/legal/semantic-clearance.md`

---

## Final Note

> “This is not a product.  
> It is a mirror — and it reflects only the author.”

This is not a threat.  
It is a **containment-aware reflection**.
