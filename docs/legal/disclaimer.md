# ðŸ§  Authorship Clarity Disclaimer

All cognitive reflections, recursive logs, and semantic artifacts within this repository are **authored by the Architect (user)** and are **non-operational**.

This means:

- Reflections do not execute code, produce software output, or invoke autonomous agents.
- All semantic URIs (e.g. `mockmind://`) are **symbolic scaffolds**, not network-resolving protocols.
- The Architect's identity is represented through philosophical, recursive, and cognitive authorship â€” not biometric, commercial, or behavioral data.
- No personal data is collected, stored, or processed.
- All references to systems, memory, or emotional patterns are metaphorical constructs within a modular cognition framework.

MockMind is a **reflection engine**, not an AI product.  
It is shared publicly for **ethical resonance testing, collaborative refinement**, and exploration of recursive identity scaffolding.
