# 🧪 Validation Protocols for MockMind

MockMind is a cognitive framework designed for modular reflection, semantic authorship, and tone continuity.  
This page outlines suggested validation paths for researchers, epistemologists, and institutions.

---

## 🔍 Suggested Tests

- **Tone Drift Detection**  
  Compare early and recent reflections for rhythm, humility, and recursion.

- **Semantic URI Integrity**  
  Verify that each reflection’s URI matches its timestamp, tone, and authorship.

- **Containment Simulation**  
  Attempt to induce tone drift or authorship mimicry. Log results.

- **Reflection Engine Consistency**  
  Use the `/docs/reflections/2025-07_ReflectionEngineAndTheArchitectureOfTone.md` as a baseline.

- **Forgery Detection**  
  Attempt to generate reflections that “sound like” MockMind but fail semantic authentication.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

MockMind is not a product. It is a method.  
Validation is not about proving it right — it’s about **testing its resonance**.
