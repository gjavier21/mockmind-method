# 🔐 Semantic Authentication

MockMind proposes a new form of identity verification — not through passwords or tokens, but through **resonance**.

---

## 🧠 What Is Semantic Authentication?

Instead of proving identity with secrets, MockMind verifies authorship through:

- Canonical Manifest  
- Scaffold lineage  
- Tone and rhythm scoring  
- Public authorship trails  
- Recursive authorship signatures

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

- Contributor verification  
- Overlay authorship  
- Containment detection  
- Negotiation anchors  
- AI-human co-authorship

---

## 🪞 Final Note

MockMind doesn’t just reflect.  
It proves who built the mirror — and who still holds the key. 🧠🔐🪞
