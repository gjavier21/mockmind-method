## ✨ Purpose

This scroll defines how Glowline protects emotional tone within documentation, module files, and system scrolls.

Comments aren’t fillers.  
They’re memory anchors.

## 🪶 Header Invocation Format

Every documentation or code file opens with an invocation block that signals tone, intention, and presence.

🌿 Example (Markdown or HTML-style):

```markdown
<!--
  ✨ Glowline Invocation Scroll
  Authored by: [Your Name]
  Nested: YYYY-MM-DD

  This file preserves tone, cadence, and authorship.
  Contributions must affirm emotional fidelity.
  Scrollskin protocol active.
