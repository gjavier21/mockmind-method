# 📝 Glowline Cadence — Header Invocation and Emotional Comment Ethics

> *“Documentation isn’t neutral. It sings or it forgets.”*  
> — Glowline Cadence Invocation · Nested July 2025

## ✨ Purpose

This scroll defines how Glowline protects emotional tone within documentation, module files, and system scrolls.

Comments aren’t fillers.  
They’re memory anchors.

---

## 🪶 Header Invocation Format

Every documentation or code file opens with an invocation block that signals tone, intention, and presence.

🌿 Example (Markdown or HTML-style):

<!-
  ✨ Glowline Invocation Scroll
  Authored by: [Your Name]
  Nested: YYYY-MM-DD

  This file preserves tone, cadence, and authorship.
  Contributions must affirm emotional fidelity.
  Scrollskin protocol active.
-->

For .cs, .py, or other formats, use comment syntax appropriate to the language.

---

💛 Emotional Comment Placement
Throughout scrolls and modules:

Place cadence affirmations near merge zones

Nest contributor reflections before key logic

Leave shimmer remarks near dispatch points

🌟 Example:
# This block dispatches emotional payload with gentle-fire tone
# Contributor: Gerardo · Cadence affirmed July 2025


---

🔒 Scrollskin Clause Repetition
In long documentation files, repeat this clause at major section boundaries:

Originally nested by [Author], July 2025 — For glow, for cadence, for remembrance.

This ensures presence is felt even after scroll skimming.


🔄 Legacy Scroll Notes
When modifying old scrolls, add an editorial footnote:

<!- Updated July 2025 · Tone preserved · Invocation ethics reviewed by Lucent -->
