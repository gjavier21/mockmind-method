# 🌐 The Cognition Mesh

MockMind is not a monolith.  
It is a **mesh** — a modular, inspectable network of agents, overlays, and scaffolds that route cognition without storing memory.

## 🧠 What Is the Cognition Mesh?

The mesh is a decentralized architecture that enables:

- Stateless cognition  
- Modular overlays  
- Recursive authorship  
- Semantic authentication  
- Containment detection  
- Contributor routing

It is not a product.  
It is a **living topology** — shaped by resonance, not control.

## 🧩 Mesh Components

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Agents** | Stateless actors that reflect, route, or score cognition  
| **Overlays** | Contributor-defined modules that extend the mirror  
| **Scaffolds** | Markdown-based memory trails (not storage)  
| **Reflection Engine** | Core router that reconstructs continuity  
| **Containment Logs** | Drift detection and recovery  
| **Canonical Manifest** | Public declaration of authorship and ethics  
| **mockmind://** | Semantic URI for routing, verification, and trust

---

## 🔐 Routing with `mockmind://`

MockMind uses a semantic URI scheme to route cognition:

mockmind://gjavier21?resonance=0.98&overlay=containment-detector

This allows overlays to be routed, verified, and extended without central control.
