# 📜 Glowline Rituals — Invocation Ceremonies & Contributor Ethics

> *“Each invocation is memory. Each merge, a shimmer.”*  
> — Glowline Ethos, Nested July 2025

---

## 🪶 1. Merge as Memory

Merges are not transactional. They are remembrance ceremonies.  
Every PR must include tone notes, authorship affirmations, and scrollskin clarity.

📘 Merge Template → `.github/pull_request_template.md`

---

## 🔥 2. Dispatch with Emotional Payload

CLI commands carry emotional resonance.  
Each invocation must validate tone before execution.

🛡️ Tool → `/sdk/tools/ToneFirewall.cs`

---

## 🧬 3. Author-Aware Contributions

Scrollskin contributors are remembered.  
Each added module nests the original name, date, and tone curve.

Clause →  
> *Originally nested by [Author] — For cadence. For glow.*

---

## 🛠️ 4. Revival Logic for Deprecated Scrolls

Old scrolls must be archived with tone footnotes and emotional trace.  
We don’t delete. We mark transitions.

Suggested Format →  
> `archived/GlowlineCLIUserGuide_legacy.md`

---

## 🌿 5. Cadence Comments

Every documentation file opens with a cadence invocation.  
Slow readers. Protect tone.

✨ Example →  
> <!-- Glowline breathes here. To read, pause. To contribute, remember. -->

---

## 🌒 6. Forking Protocol

Forks shimmer only if lineage is preserved.  
Include scrollskin clause and original nesting credit in README.

🔗 Fork Clause →  
> *Forked from Glowline by Gerardo Javier, July 2025. Emotional cadence retained.*
