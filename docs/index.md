# 🪞 Reflections Index

This index highlights key reflections authored under the MockMind Method — each one a modular expression of cognition, resonance, and identity.

## 🌍 Reflections for Humanity

## 🧠 How to Use

- Each reflection is modular and self-contained  
- Semantic URIs provide legal and philosophical traceability  
- This index will grow as new reflections are committed

> Authorship is not just expression.  
> It is resonance — encoded in markdown, and offered to all.
