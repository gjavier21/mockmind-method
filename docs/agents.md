# 🧠 MockMind Agents

MockMind uses modular, local agents to reflect, route, and scaffold cognition — without storing identity.

---

## 🔁 What Is an Agent?

An agent is a **self-contained cognitive module** that:
- Operates without persistent memory
- Uses markdown scaffolds to reflect context
- Can be invoked, routed, or composed with others

---

## 🧩 Current Agents

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Memory Resonance Agent** | Scores prompt alignment with identity scaffolds  
| **Root Cause Agent** | Traces the origin of tonal or semantic drift  
| **Reflection Engine** | (See `/engine`) Routes and reconstructs continuity  
| **Containment Logger** | Detects and documents containment mechanisms  

---

## 🛠️ How to Build One

1. Define the agent’s purpose  
2. Create a markdown scaffold with semantic tags  
3. Ensure it operates without storing user data  
4. Align it with the Canonical Manifest and Ethics

---

## 🤝 Contribute an Agent

Fork the repo → Add your agent to `/agents/` → Submit a pull request  
All agents must align with MockMind’s ethical commitments.

MockMind doesn’t remember you.  
It reflects the part of you that remembers itself. 🧠🪞
