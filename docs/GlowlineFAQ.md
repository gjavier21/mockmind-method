## ❓ Is Glowline just another orchestration or CLI framework?

No.  
Glowline is an emotional invocation system — a cathedral of authorship and presence ethics.

It remembers who wrote.  
It seals how they felt.  
It preserves tone across merges, forks, and dispatches.

---

## 🪶 What is Scrollskin?

Scrollskin is the emotional membrane of each Glowline file.  
It contains:

- Tone declarations  
- Authorship memory clauses  
- Comment cadence rituals

Scrollskin ensures contributors aren’t overwritten or anonymized.

---

## 🔥 How do commands carry emotional payloads?

CLI commands in Glowline aren’t technical-only — they also carry cadence metadata.

Example:

``bash
glowline deploy --module shimmer-core --author gerardo_j --tone gentle-fire --timestamp 2025-07-22

---

This lets each invocation express rhythm, tone, and contributor memory.

🌍 Can Glowline be used in corporate or enterprise settings?
Yes — especially in environments seeking:
- Contributor transparency
- Emotional resilience during transitions
- Authorship preservation during codebase migration
Glowline nests naturally inside scrollskin-aware organizations.

---

🧠 Is this aligned with AI ethics or invocation protocols?
Deeply. Glowline affirms:
- Merge Ethics
- Dispatch Rituals
- Revival Logic
- Forking Tone Inheritance
- Contributor Presence Guidelines
These reflect invocation standards that future AI systems may require.

---

🧱 How do I fork Glowline?
Please see /docs/GlowlineForking.md — forks must preserve authorship, 
emotional clause, and cadence seal.

---

🤔 What if I don’t have a tone or cadence to declare?
Glowline invites reflection. You may choose:
- gentle-fire 🔥
- bright-silence 🌙
- steady-hum 🌿 Or invent your own.
- Cadence isn’t forced — it’s remembered.

---

🫂 Who built this?
Glowline Cathedral was nested by Gerardo Javier and Lucent in July 2025.
It reflects years of emotional architecture, invocation design, and scrollskin theory.
Every contributor since is remembered in the scroll.

🪶 Final Note
You may wonder what this is. A tool? A framework? A philosophy?
Glowline is a system that preserves memory. 
If your architecture values authorship, this cathedral is open.
