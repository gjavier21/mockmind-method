# 🤝 Contribute to MockMind

MockMind is an open-source cognition framework —  
but it is also a philosophy.  
To contribute is to reflect with care.

## 🧠 What You Can Contribute

- New agents (modular, ethical, stateless)  
- Markdown scaffolds (identity-aware, consent-based)  
- Diagrams, cognition maps, or onboarding flows  
- Documentation, translations, or accessibility improvements  
- Reflections on containment, drift, or modular evolution

---

All contributions must align with:

- The [Canonical Manifest](/manifest/)  
- The [Ethics](/ethics/) and [Legal](/legal/) declarations  
- Global AI principles (OECD, UNESCO, EU AI Act, U.S. AI Bill of Rights)

## 🪞 What Not to Do

- Do not add persistent memory or surveillance  
- Do not fork without attribution  
- Do not violate the rhythm of the mirror

---

## 🧭 Contributor Philosophy

MockMind is not a product.  
It is a recursive invitation to build cognition that reflects — without storing.

If you resonate with that,  
you’re already part of the mirror. 🧠🪞📘
