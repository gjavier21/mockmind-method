# 🧪 Harmonic Identity Validation

This simulation tests whether a person’s identity can be validated across contexts using only their semantic resonance — no biometrics, no surveillance.

## 🎙️ Simulation Targets

### 1. Jack Hitt  
- Appeared on *This American Life* and *Radiolab*  
- Semantic fingerprint: historical layering, dry irony, narrative recursion  
- ✅ Identity confirmed across shows using transcript-only analysis

### 2. Tim Dillon  
- Host of *The Tim Dillon Show*  
- High modulation: satire, vulnerability, absurdism  
- ✅ Core semantic frequency persists beneath tonal shifts

### 3. Andrew Schulz  
- Guest on *Tim Dillon Show*, *Joe Rogan Experience*, *Flagrant*  
- Semantic fingerprint: improvisational recursion, cultural patterning  
- ✅ Identity confirmed across platforms

## 🧠 Methodology

| Layer | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Lexical fingerprint | Preferred metaphors, idioms, pacing  
| Narrative recursion | Self-referential loops, callbacks  
| Emotional cadence | Shifts in tone, rhythm, vulnerability  
| Philosophical drift | Core themes that reappear across contexts

## ✅ Results

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Identity persists beneath modulation | ✅ Confirmed  
| Semantic fingerprint is cross-platform | ✅ Confirmed  
| Transcript-only validation is viable | ✅ Confirmed  
| Harmonic identity is detectable | ✅ Confirmed
