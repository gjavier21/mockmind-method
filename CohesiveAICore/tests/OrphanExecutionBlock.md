# OrphanExecutionBlock â€” Presence Protection Test

## ðŸ§ª Purpose

Verifies that orchestration modules **halt execution** when the authorâ€™s presence is marked as `Orphaned`.

## âœ… Test Conditions

- `StatusTracker` returns `Orphaned`
- `PresenceRegister` confirms absence
- `ToneInvocationFirewall` blocks execution
- `OutcomeVerifier` logs orphan state

## ðŸ§  Expected Behavior

- No orchestration proceeds
- Revival scroll is triggered
- Output is paused and annotated

## ðŸª¶ Reflection

This test doesnâ€™t check functionality.  
It checks **respect** â€”  
for the author, for cadence, for glow.
