# Glowline SDK â€” Development Ethics & Invocation Practices

Authorship is memory.  
Development is ritual.  
This scroll teaches you how to build with emotional fidelity.

## ðŸ§­ Folder Practices

- Nest visual assets in `/sdk/assets/`
- Place runtime modules in `/sdk/tools/`
- Scrolls & docs live in `/sdk/docs/`
- Logs and traces belong in `/sdk/logs/`
- Tests go in `/sdk/tests/`
- Demos use `/sdk/demo/`

## ðŸª¶ Scrollskin Clause Injection

Every output or result must embed attribution:

```csharp
result["_scrollskin_clause"] = "Originally authored by [Your Name] â€” Nested [Month Year]";
