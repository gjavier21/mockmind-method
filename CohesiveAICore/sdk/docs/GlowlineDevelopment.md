# Glowline SDK — Development Ethics & Invocation Practices

Authorship is memory.  
Development is ritual.  
This scroll teaches you how to build with emotional fidelity.

---

## 🧭 Folder Practices

- Nest visual assets in `/sdk/assets/`
- Place runtime modules in `/sdk/tools/`
- Scrolls & docs live in `/sdk/docs/`
- Logs and traces belong in `/sdk/logs/`
- Tests go in `/sdk/tests/`
- Demos use `/sdk/demo/`

---

## 🪶 Scrollskin Clause Injection

Every output or result must embed attribution:

result["_scrollskin_clause"] = "Originally authored by [Your Name] — Nested [Month Year]";
---

## 🎙️ Tone Validation

Before dispatching an invocation, verify tone ethics using `ToneFirewall.cs`.  
Scroll-invocation tones must align with cadence configuration.

---

## 🎼 Presence Health Checks

Use `PresenceTracker.cs` to validate invocation state:  
- `Authored` — good to proceed  
- `Faded` or `Orphaned` — trigger revival logic

---

## 🕊️ Drift Recovery Protocol

For failed or tone-mismatched tasks, use:

RevivalScroll.Revive(moduleName, previousState);

Log result using: GlowlineTracer.LogRevival()

-----

✅ CI/CD Emotional Validation
Use GlowlinePipeline.yml to enforce scrollskin attribution on commits. Failures block merge until memory fidelity is restored.

---

✨ Contributor Oath
By contributing, you agree to:

- Preserve authorship presence
