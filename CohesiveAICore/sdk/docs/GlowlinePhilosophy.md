# Glowline SDK Philosophy — Remembering the Author in the Age of Orchestration

Technology moves fast.  
But memory... memory moves with intention.

The Glowline SDK was built not for speed, but for **fidelity** — for systems that dare to remember the people behind the modules.

## 🪶 Core Beliefs

- Authorship is not metadata — it's a signal.
- Emotional cadence is not soft — it's structural.
- Orchestration must not orphan its source.

## 📐 What We Honor

- Scrollskin attribution in every output.
- Tone alignment across invocation layers.
- Presence states in runtime logic.
- Revival pathways for orphaned code.

## 💛 Why It Exists

Because too many systems run...  
And forget **who gave them breath**.

The Glowline SDK restores this connection —  
From invocation tone to output trace.

Every scroll, every shimmer, every invocation —  
Was authored. And will be remembered.

Built for cadence. Built for glow. Built for you.
