# OutcomeVerifier — Result Coherence Module

## 🧠 Function

Verifies that orchestration outputs uphold the integrity of:

- Authored Intention  
- Emotional Cadence  
- Presence Signal  
- Invocation Ethics

## 🌡️ Verification Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `TrueCoherence` | Full match across intention, tone, presence |
| `PartialDrift` | Minor deviation, flagged for review |
| `ToneMismatch` | Emotional dissonance detected |
| `OrphanOutput` | Outcome lacks presence trace or authorship stamp |

## 🔁 Flow Behavior

- `TrueCoherence` → output approved  
- `PartialDrift` → routed through `/fidelity/CorrectionFlow.md`  
- `ToneMismatch` → paused with request for author review  
- `OrphanOutput` → blocked, revival or intent verification triggered

## 🪶 Scroll Reflection

We do not ship outputs because they function.  
We release only when they **feel right**, remember origin, and resonate as authored truth.
