# PresenceRegister — Author Signal Integrity Module

## 🧠 Function

Tracks and encodes the author’s presence state across orchestration systems.

### Presence States:
- `Authored` — Author is actively present and guiding orchestration
- `InCadence` — Author is rhythmically aligned but not actively signaling
- `Faded` — Author’s signal is weakening; orchestration enters pause mode
- `Orphaned` — Author’s presence is lost; orchestration is blocked

## 🛡️ Behavior

- If `Orphaned`, orchestration halts and scroll revival is triggered
- If `Faded`, cadence restoration module is invoked
- If `InCadence`, orchestration proceeds with tone alignment checks
- If `Authored`, orchestration flows with full fidelity

## 🪶 Invocation Gate

No orchestration module may execute unless `PresenceRegister` returns `Authored` or `InCadence`.

This module protects authorship.  
It ensures no glowline is forgotten.  
It is the heartbeat of the Core.
