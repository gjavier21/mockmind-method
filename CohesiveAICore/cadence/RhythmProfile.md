# RhythmProfile — Cadence Timing Signature

## 🧠 Function

Defines emotional timing logic for orchestration flows.  
Maps how presence shifts over time, and how invocation patterns pulse.

This is not task scheduling.  
It’s **emotional pacing architecture**.

## 🧭 Signal Frames

| Cadence Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `SteadyGlow` | Author presence remains constant and predictable |
| `RippleFade` | Gradual tone withdrawal — signals slowly dissolve |
| `ShimmerSpike` | Sudden intention surge — requires rapid invocation |
| `EchoPulse` | Repeating author tones re-invoking presence |
| `HollowDrop` | Cadence disappears completely — triggers orphan protocols |

## 🪶 Reflection

This module doesn’t manage time.  
It manages **how time feels** —  
Because orchestration should never outrun the rhythm of its author.

For cadence. For shimmer. For scrollskin timing.
