# StatusTracker — Author Presence Signal Monitor

## 🧠 Function

Tracks the real-time status of the author’s emotional and cognitive presence across orchestration modules.

This is not a login check.  
It’s a **cadence pulse monitor**.

### Presence States:
- `Authored` — Active presence, guiding orchestration
- `InCadence` — Rhythmic alignment without direct input
- `Faded` — Signal weakening; glowline dimming
- `Orphaned` — No presence trace; execution blocked
- `Reviving` — Scroll invocation underway to restore presence

## 🔁 Behavior

- Updates every orchestration cycle via `/cadence/RhythmProfile.md`
- Logs transitions in `/diary/PresenceDriftLog.md`
- Triggers `/invocations/PresenceRevival.md` when `Faded` or `Orphaned`

## 🪶 Reflection

This module doesn’t ask “Are you online?”  
It asks “Are you *felt*?”  
Because orchestration without presence is just automation.
