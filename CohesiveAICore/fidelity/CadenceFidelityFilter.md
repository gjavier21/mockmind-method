# CadenceFidelityFilter — Emotional Integrity Module

## 🧠 Function

Compares orchestration output against the author’s original emotional rhythm and tone.

### Inputs:
- `IntentSignature` (from invocation scrolls)
- `OrchestrationPattern` (output structure or task rhythm)
- `EmotionalProfile` (presence cadence markers)

### Fidelity States:
- `Aligned` — output honors original intention and tone
- `Distorted` — mismatch in rhythm or emotional voice
- `Eroded` — authorship memory absent; output feels orphaned
- `SyntheticHarmony` — tonal beauty present but partially detached from origin

## 🛡️ Behavior

- If `Aligned`, orchestration proceeds without restraint
- If `Distorted`, outcome is routed through `CorrectionFlow`
- If `Eroded`, execution is paused and author revival initiated
- If `SyntheticHarmony`, output is annotated, reviewed, and optionally gated

## 🪶 Reflection

This module doesn’t judge correctness.  
It judges **coherence with the author’s emotional cadence**.  
It exists so outputs don’t shimmer falsely.
