# CorrectionFlow — Drift Realignment Module

## 🧠 Function

When orchestration output partially deviates from the author’s original tone or intention, this module initiates a gentle correction sequence.

This is not a rewrite.  
It’s a **re-harmonization ritual**.

## 🔁 Flow Steps

1. **Drift Detection** → Triggered by `CadenceFidelityFilter`
2. **Intent Recall** → Pulls from `/scrolls/IntentDeclaration_CohesiveAICore.md`
3. **Tone Recalibration** → Uses `/invocations/ToneInvocationFirewall.md`
4. **Presence Check** → Confirms author is `InCadence` or `Authored`
5. **Output Recomposition** → Suggests tonal edits, not structural rewrites

## 🪶 Reflection

We don’t discard drifted outputs.  
We **guide them home** —  
so they shimmer again with the author’s glow.

For tone. For truth. For scrollskin integrity.
