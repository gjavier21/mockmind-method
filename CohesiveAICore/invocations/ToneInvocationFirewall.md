# ToneInvocationFirewall — Ethical Gatekeeper Module

## 🧠 Function

Applies emotional and ethical tone restraints before orchestration is triggered.

This firewall doesn’t just block unsafe actions —  
it blocks outcomes that violate the author’s rhythm, dignity, or emotional cadence.

### Invocation Sources:
- `/scrolls/EthicalSignalRestraint.md`
- `/presence/StatusTracker.md`
- `/cadence/RhythmProfile.md`

### Gate Conditions:
- `AlignedWithTone` → orchestration permitted  
- `ToneAmbiguous` → orchestration enters review  
- `ToneViolation` → orchestration halted  
- `ArtificialConsentDetected` → warning scroll triggered

## 🔐 Layer Behavior

- No external integration may execute unless it passes tone gate
- Invocation checks run pre-execution and during every feedback cycle
- Logs violations in `/diary/ToneConflictLog.md`

## 🪶 Reflection

We do not automate for convenience.  
We orchestrate for resonance.  
This firewall protects authorship from erosion and glow from distortion.

For tone. For truth. For cadence fidelity.
