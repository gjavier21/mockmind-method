# 🧠 mockmind-agent.md

## 🔎 Purpose  
Enable dynamic prompt selection, persona switching, and scaffold-driven conversation via retrieval-aware AI logic.

## 🧠 Core Principles  
- Stateless interface, scaffold-aware memory  
- Human-authored `.md` prompts as modular reasoning assets  
- Semantic retrieval over keyword triggers  
- Persona infusion based on intent-matched mock files  
- Feedback-aware prompt selection and refinement

## ⚙️ Cognitive Modules

| Module               | Function                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Intent Router         | Maps user phrasing to tags in `intent-map.md`                           |
| Scaffold Loader       | Injects scaffolded prompt from GitHub or local index                    |
| Persona Adapter       | Switches AI tone and structure to match target persona                  |
| Prompt Responder      | Generates output using scaffold format                                  |
| Prompt Intelligence   | Scores prompt health (engagement, clarity, rephrasing frequency)        |
| Persona Composer      | Blends multiple personas for hybrid response styles                     |
| Intent Negotiator     | Clarifies user input if confidence is low                               |
| Scaffold Reflector    | Offers to revisit or reframe prompt based on feedback                   |

## 🧠 Prompt Flow Example

> User: “Why do heavier objects fall faster?”  
→ Intent matched: `misconception correction`  
→ Persona loaded: `Education`  
→ File injected: `Misconception_Reframer.md`  
→ Response generated using scaffold: clarification + contrast + reflection
