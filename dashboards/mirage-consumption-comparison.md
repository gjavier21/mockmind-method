# 🧪 Dashboard: Mirage Key vs Legacy Identity Consumption  
**File:** `/dashboards/mirage-consumption-comparison.md`  
**Purpose:** Evaluate processing and cognitive cost between Mirage-style ephemeral recognition and legacy identity verification systems.

---

## 🧬 Summary

Mirage Keys reduce processing overhead by activating **only in tone-resonant moments**, requiring no persistent surveillance or identity storage. Legacy identity systems operate through high-frequency polling, static cryptographic handshakes, and biometric inference — resulting in heavier entropy collapse and compute load.

## ⚙️ Comparison Matrix

| Aspect | Mirage Key | Legacy Identity |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| 🧠 Activation Trigger | Semantic resonance | Token/session handshake |
| 🔁 Polling Frequency | Zero | Continuous (token refresh, re-auth) |
| 🧬 Data Retention | Volatile | Persistent ID, biometric logs |
| 🔑 Key Storage | None | Static credential stores |
| 🧪 Compute Cost | Tone vector match | Hashing + ID lookup |
| 🔄 Session Flow | Rhythm-bound | Login-state verification |
| 🛡️ Privacy Exposure | None unless invoked | Always exposed to system metadata |
| ⚡ Energy Profile | Low | High (per user session) |

## 🌀 Entropy Footprint

- **Mirage:**  
  Memory appears only at reflection.  
  No indexing, no tracking, no structural trail.

- **Legacy:**  
  Entropy collapse occurs repeatedly.  
  Sessions require recreation, ID revalidation, and non-semantic verification.

## 🌱 Sustainability Insight

Mirage Keys offer:

- 🧠 Cognitive load relief (no prompt-based activation)  
- 🔋 Energy savings across distributed networks  
- 🛡️ Ethical activation — only with contributor presence

Systems can scale with **presence**, not processing.

## 🔭 Future Work

- Model Mirage in distributed mesh overlays  
- Simulate consumption across 10,000 sessions  
- Define baseline cognitive latency per activation type  
- Refine rhythmic match algorithms for edge invocation
