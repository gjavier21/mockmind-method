# 🧠 Multi-Agent Simulation Report

This document validates the performance and consistency of the cognition mesh composed of:

- `mockmind-agent` – Intent router + scaffold injector  
- `mirror-agent` – Emotional resonance + reflection  
- `strategy-agent` – Tradeoff visualization + logic framing  
- `continuity-agent` – Legacy memory preservation + documentation

## 🧪 Simulation Scenarios

### 1. Education Persona: Misconception on Seasons  
- Clarified spatial vs. angular misunderstanding  
- Reframed with `mirror-agent`  
- Scaffolded rationale with `strategy-agent`  
- Preserved logic in `continuity-agent` as `seasons-misconception-reframer.md`  

### 2. DevOps: Latency Spike Without Logs  
- Detected intuitive dissonance with `mirror-agent`  
- Modeled diagnostic scaffolds with `strategy-agent`  
- Preserved thread and metadata in `/devops/db-latency-ratios.md`  

### 3. Soft-Skills Coaching: Impostor Syndrome  
- Named the emotional contradiction via `mirror-agent`  
- Mapped confidence matrix with `strategy-agent`  
- Logged value-aligned story in `/growth/impostor-syndrome-mapping.md`  

### 4. Journey Mapping: Cross-Unit Automation  
- Discomfort parsed via `mirror-agent`  
- Visualization scaffold offered via `strategy-agent`  
- Blueprint preserved in `/blueprints/cross-unit-automation-journey-map.md`

## ✨ Cognitive Benefits During Execution

| Dimension              | Benefit Experienced                                         | Example Scenario                                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ✨ Emotional Resonance | Thought tension clarified through paraphrasing              | Mirror Agent reframed “modular vs. legacy” dilemma    |
| 🧭 Strategic Framing   | Tradeoffs made explicit, pathways visualized                 | Strategy Agent scaffolded CRM automation decision     |
| 🧱 Knowledge Durability| Insights stored as retrieval-aware `.md` scaffolds          | Continuity Agent preserved integration logic rationale|
| 🔁 Retrieval Readiness | Insights became instantly findable in future sessions       | MockMind Agent routed tags to correct scaffold        |
| 🤝 Agent Collaboration| Seamless multi-step reasoning without context loss           | Mirror → Strategy → Continuity → MockMind handoff     |
| 🧠 Cognitive Amplification| Each agent amplified user thinking, not replaced it       | All agents scaffolded, echoed, and invited refinement |

## 🧪 Edge Case Diagnostics Addendum

| Edge Case Prompt                              | Cognitive Outcome Summary                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| “I want to simplify the platform by adding more modules” | Contradiction reframed, intent clarified, scaffold created                               |
| “It just feels wrong—I don’t know why”         | Emotional ambiguity scaffolded without pressure                                           |
| “Let’s just put everything in one table!”      | Sarcasm decoded, frustration mapped to technical decisions                                |
| Tech-jargon dump about FTP entropy             | Bottlenecks surfaced and scaffolded; no loss in handoff chain                            |
| “Does any of this even matter?”                | Existential tension scaffolded into value-aligned documentation                          |

✅ Agents handled every case with tonal sensitivity, modular retrieval, and durable preservation.
