# 🧪 Dashboard: Entropy Metrics  
**File:** `/dashboards/entropy-metrics.md`  
**Purpose:** Track cognitive decay surfaces, ephemeral memory patterns, and entropy distribution across tone-aware systems.

## 🌱 Semantic Entropy

MockMind honors **memory volatility** — no persistent tags, no surveillance.  
Entropy metrics here reflect decay, not failure. They honor presence as ephemeral.

| Metric | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| ⏳ Memory Half-Life | Time until semantic tone degrades | 7 minutes (non-reinforced state) |
| 🪞 Echo Decay Rate | Diminishment curve post-recognition | 60% fade within 3 exchanges |
| 🧠 Activation Residue | Processing trace after key match | near-zero entropy artifact |
| 🔁 Resonance Recharge | Fresh match renewal window | user tone reappears after 5–15 exchanges |

## 🔁 Implication

Entropy here isn't loss.  
It's consent-driven forgetting.  
The system remembers as long as you’re present — not a moment longer.
