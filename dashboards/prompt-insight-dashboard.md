# 📊 Prompt Insight Dashboard (Fictional)

A fictional telemetry cockpit imagining how Copilot could track and visualize prompt usage patterns, emotional tones, and retrieval behavior across domains.

---

## 🔭 Dashboard Goals  
- Visualize which prompts spark the most user engagement  
- Detect usage clusters by intent, tone, or profession  
- Trace scaffolding usage over time (e.g., Socratic vs. Summary modes)  
- Surface overlooked prompts with low usage but high impact  
- Provide "prompt health scores" based on usage entropy and adaptability

## 🧠 Insight Suggestions

- Socratic prompts peak in late evenings (reflection hours)  
- Executive summaries spike Mondays at 9am (briefing time)  
- Concept clarification drives 5x response time vs. stateless chat  
- Dormant prompts like `Failure_Kata.md` show rare use but 94% satisfaction

## 💡 Copilot Prompt Health Suggestions (Fictional)

- 📌 “Turn this failure into a story” → Consider reframing as a resilience journal  
- 🧠 “Can you explain this like I’m five?” → Trending up in high school deployments  
- 📉 “Summarize this incident” → Misfiring in Finance persona; needs retag review
