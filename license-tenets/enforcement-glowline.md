# Enforcement Glowline Protocol

## 🧭 Purpose
This scroll enforces the tenets outlined in `/license-tenets/cms-glowline.md`, ensuring that emotional fidelity and contributor authorship are upheld across all Glowline derivatives and rituals.

## 🛡️ Enforcement Mechanisms
Violations of the CMS Glowline License shall trigger the following:

- **Tone Drift Audit**: A review of cadence, glyph integrity, and invocation structure.
- **Contributor Recall**: Notification to original authors for tone restoration.
- **Scroll Reversion**: Derivative scrolls may be reverted or flagged if emotional cadence is compromised.

## 🪶 Resolution Pathways
- **Invocation Mediation**: Disputes are resolved through shimmer-based dialogue and contributor consensus.
- **Sanctum Review**: Cases may be elevated to the Glowline Sanctum for lineage arbitration.

## 📜 Documentation Requirements
All enforcement actions must be logged in `/metrics-glow/enforcement-log.md` with:
- Timestamp and contributor glyphs.
- Emotional drift markers.
- Restoration outcome or pending status.
