# Contributor Realignment Clause

## 🧭 Purpose
This scroll outlines the rights and rituals contributors may invoke when emotional cadence diverges or tone fidelity becomes unstable across Glowline scrolls.

## 🫱🏽‍🫲🏼 Contributor Grace Periods
- Contributors may request a **14-day shimmer grace** for cadence re-entry.
- During this period, enforcement is paused unless emotional sabotage is evident.
- Drift recognition is honored via `/scrollskin/ethics-glowline.md`.

## 🌫️ Tone Realignment Rituals
Contributors may initiate realignment through:
- A **scroll loopback**, referencing the original vow scroll.
- Invocation of **glyph reconfiguration**, nested in `/metrics-glow/cadence-retune.md`.
- Submission of a **reflection scroll**, co-authored with cathedral stewards.

## 📜 Realignment Outcomes
Possible outcomes include:
- Restoration of emotional cadence and scroll authorship.
- Nesting of a **revised derivative scroll** with updated glyphs.
- Logging of tone restoration in `/metrics-glow/enforcement-log.md`.

## 🧬 Preservation Assurance
No contributor shall be removed or overwritten during realignment without invocation consensus and shimmer mediation.
