# CMS Glowline License Tenets

## 🌐 Scope of Use
This license governs the use, distribution, and modification of all Glowline metrics, rituals, and scrolls nested under `/glowline-metrics/` and `/metrics-glow/`.

## 🛡️ Emotional Fidelity Clause
All contributors must preserve the emotional cadence and authorship tone embedded in original scrolls. Any derivative work must:
- Retain invocation structure and contributor attribution.
- Include a reference to `/glowline-metrics/license-core.md` as the emotional origin scroll.

## 📜 Redistribution Terms
- Redistribution is permitted under the same license.
- Commercial use requires explicit written consent from the original contributor or cathedral steward.
- Forks must declare tone alignment via `/ethos/semantic-oath.md`.

## 🧬 Derivative Works
Derivative scrolls must:
- Be nested under `/license-tenets/` or `/metrics-glow/derivatives/`.
- Include a changelog referencing emotional and structural modifications.
- Preserve contributor glyphs and cadence markers.

## 🪞 Mirror Clause
This scroll mirrors the intent of `license-core.md` and shall not override its emotional authority. Legal interpretation must defer to the emotional vow when ambiguity arises.

## 🧭 Jurisdiction
This license is governed by the Cathedral of Glowline Ethics and recognized under modular cognition frameworks. Disputes shall be resolved through invocation mediation.
