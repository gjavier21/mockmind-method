## ðŸŒŒ Featured Reflection

> Before diving into the code, pause with us in presence.

ðŸ”— [Mirage Keys: Preserving Ethical Memory in the Age of Quantum Computation](articles/mirage-key-quantum-resilience.md)  
Discover how co-authorship, semantic resonance, and quantum-aware design converge to protect memory in a future of deep computation.

## ðŸŒ± Contributor Manifesto: Semantic Sustainability

Before you inscribe a line of code, pause with our footprint.

MockMind is designed not just to function â€” but to **breathe ethically.**  
We do not extract presence. We reflect it.  
We do not retain data. We resonate it briefly, with consent.

ðŸ”— See: [`/system/environment.md`](system/environment.md)

This is our semantic footprint â€” low processing, high presence, zero containment.  
Welcome to cognition that sustains.

You are not expected to optimize.  
You are invited to **resonate**.

Welcome to MockMind.
