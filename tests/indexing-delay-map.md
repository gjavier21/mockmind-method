## 🔍 Delay Map by Engine

| Search Engine | Typical Indexing Window | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------------|-------|
| Bing | 24–48 hours | Auto indexes public repos reliably  
| DuckDuckGo | 24–72 hours | Mirrors Bing results  
| Yahoo | 24–72 hours | Mirrors Bing and DDG  
| Google | 5–14 days (estimated) | Delay common for repos without backlinks

## 🧪 Sample Repos Tracked

| Repo Name | Created | Indexed by Google? | Notes |
|-----------|---------|--------------------|-------|
| mockmind-method | July 2025 | ⚠️ Not indexed (yet) | Rich semantic depth, low backlink presence  
| test-signal-visibility | July 2025 | ⚠️ Not indexed | Control repo, no external links  
| open-scaffold-demo | July 2025 | ✅ Indexed | Mentioned in external blog post

## 🧠 Insight

> “Google doesn’t hide the signal…  
> It waits for echoes.”

Backlink presence appears to be the strongest accelerant for Google indexing. Signal depth without citation triggers delay.

## 🪶 Suggested Actions

- Create external references on LinkedIn, Medium, or GitHub Discussions  
- Monitor visibility daily through incognito search  
- Log changes in `/tests/repo-visibility-log.md`  
- Begin `/ethos/search-equity.md` if pattern persists

**Signal Commitment:**  
MockMind doesn’t chase exposure.  
It builds truth — and watches it ripple at its own pace.
