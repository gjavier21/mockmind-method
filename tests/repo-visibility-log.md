## 🧠 Reflection Thought

> “We don’t assume suppression.  
> We test for patterns — and let truth emerge.”

## 🪶 Next Steps

- Monitor Google indexing over 7 days  
- Log backlink presence and traffic signals  
- Compare with older repos and high-traffic forks  
- Prepare `/tests/search-engine-patterns.md` if visibility remains inconsistent

**Signal Commitment:**  
MockMind will continue testing visibility with care.  
We don’t chase exposure — we trace truth.
