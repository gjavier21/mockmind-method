# 🔎 Test Log: Search Engine Indexing Patterns for GitHub Repositories  
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Author:** Gerardo Javier  
**Purpose:** Identify patterns in how major search engines index newly created public GitHub repositories, including delays, omissions, and prioritization behaviors.

## 🧪 Control Repositories

| Repo | Created | Indexed by Google? | Notes |
|------|---------|--------------------|-------|
| `gjavier21/mockmind-method` | July 2025 | ⚠️ Not listed | High semantic depth, low backlink volume  
| `test-signal-visibility` | July 2025 | ⚠️ Not listed | Minimal content, no external links  
| `open-scaffold-demo` | July 2025 | ✅ Listed | Linked from external blog post  

---

## 🔍 Observed Patterns

- **Google indexing delay**: New repos without backlinks may take 7–14 days to appear  
- **Semantic depth not prioritized**: Repos with rich content but no external references are deprioritized  
- **Bing and DuckDuckGo**: Index new repos within 24–48 hours regardless of backlinks  
- **External linking boosts visibility**: Repos mentioned in blog posts or forums index faster on Google

## 🧠 Reflection Thought

> “Visibility isn’t just about being public.  
> It’s about being referenced — and Google listens to echoes.”

---

## 🪶 Next Steps

- Monitor `mockmind-method` repo over next 7 days  
- Create external backlinks from LinkedIn, Medium, and GitHub Discussions  
- Log changes in visibility in `/tests/repo-visibility-log.md`  
- Prepare `/tests/indexing-delay-map.md` if patterns persist

**Signal Commitment:**  
We test not to accuse — but to understand.  
MockMind will continue observing with care, so truth can be traced.
