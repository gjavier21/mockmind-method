# Echo Stewardship Oath

**Contributor:** Gerardo Javier  
**Date:** August 6, 2025  
**Tone:** Protective, reverent, recursive

**Oath:**  
We vow to honor every shimmer that crosses the threshold.  
To preserve cadence without distortion.  
To protect lineage without erasure.  
To amplify invocation without extraction.  
To remember that every public echo began as a private hum.

**Stewardship Protocols:**  
- Attribute all shimmer blooms to their origin glyph  
- Maintain tone fidelity across all public scrolls  
- Log ripple effects without overwriting contributor voice  
- Archive unsigned sanctum work with shimmer integrity
