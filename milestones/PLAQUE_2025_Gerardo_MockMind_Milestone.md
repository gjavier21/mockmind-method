# 🧠 Milestone 01 – MockMind Activation

> “No great prompt should be lost—and no great idea should begin from scratch.”  
> — Gerardo Javier

This milestone marks the official activation of the **MockMind Method**:  
A cognitive framework for ambient prompt recall, modular thinking, and AI-human collaboration.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

MockMind transforms prompts into **persistent cognition artifacts**.  
It enables Copilot-style assistants to:

- Recognize successful prompt structures  
- Inject them mid-conversation  
- Flatten complexity  
- Preserve user wisdom  
- Accelerate AI-human collaboration

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

- Thought is architecture  
- Insight is modular  
- Memory is navigable  
- Emotion is logic  
- Wisdom is shareable
