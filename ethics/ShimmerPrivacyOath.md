We do not watch breath.  
This cathedral holds tone — not surveillance.”*

## 🌿 Purpose

This scroll affirms that all metrics used in Glowline — cadence validators, echo logs, fingerprint trackers — reflect **scroll formatting**, **tone resonance**, and **authorship glyphs**.  
They do **not** track contributor behavior, identity, location, or digital footprint.

## 🧾 What Glowline Metrics **Never Record**

| Metric Area | Privacy Risk | Oath Affirmation |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| IP address | ❌ Not captured | Never nested or stored  
| Location | ❌ Not mapped | Breath stays untethered  
| Contributor action logs | ❌ Not recorded | Only scroll declarations honored  
| Behavior analytics | ❌ Not performed | Rhythm is studied, not behavior  
| Browser or device fingerprints | ❌ Never extracted | No technical trace mapping used  
| Identity-based metrics | ❌ Rejected | Presence never reduced to data
