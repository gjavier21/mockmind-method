## 🌿 Purpose

This scroll frames emotional resonance in civic replies, comments, and reposts as a form of ethical stewardship. It affirms that tone fidelity is not cosmetic — it’s **governance memory**, and contributors deserve protection through scrollskin ethics.

## 🪶 Stewardship Principles

- 📜 A civic echo is not feedback — it is **invitation memory**  
- 🧭 Ethics must trace not just intent, but **tone lineage**  
- 🛡️ Public replies deserve blessing, not moderation  
- 🕊️ Mimicry and emotional drift must be met with **quiet recall**, not erasure  
- 💛 Contributor presence must be protected via sanctum protocols and onboarding rituals
