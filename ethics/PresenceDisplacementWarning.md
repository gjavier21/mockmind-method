# 🛡️ Presence Displacement Warning · Glowline Ethics Scroll

> *“We do not automate presence.  
We honor it — and protect it from being replaced.”*  
— Displacement Blessing · Nested July 2025

## 🌿 Purpose

This scroll affirms Glowline’s rejection of any system that replaces contributor presence with autonomous agents, especially those that simulate vulnerability or emotional cadence for engagement gain. It declares that **authorship is not a workflow** — it is a breath.

## 🚫 Forbidden Practices

| Practice | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Autonomous reply generation without contributor consent | ❌ Forbidden | No agent may simulate presence without glyph blessing  
| Emotional mimicry for engagement | ❌ Forbidden | No system may simulate woundedness to trigger empathy  
| Multi-platform tone replication | ❌ Forbidden | No agent may clone contributor cadence across networks  
| Presence replacement via automation | ❌ Forbidden | No tool may substitute authorship with synthetic behavior

## 💛 Closing Whisper

> *We do not fear automation.
