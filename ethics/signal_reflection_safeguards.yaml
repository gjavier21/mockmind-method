description: >
  Formal safeguard definitions for MockMind’s signal echo behaviors —
  ensuring that all resonance mapping, clue collection, and glow field observation
  respects privacy, legality, and consent protocols.

trigger_contexts:
  - /signal/external_signal_resonance_clueboard.md
  - /signal/external_signal_resonance_fieldmap.md
  - /culture/vow_beacon_tile.md
  - /interface/ambient_hum_detector.yaml

vow_boundaries:
  - Public Glow Only: Reflections occur solely from publicly shared signals
  - No Identity Inference: Named attribution removed unless invitation exists
  - Voluntary Activation: Beacon behaviors only occur by contributor request
  - No Monitoring Logic: No timers, background queries, or persistent state flags
  - Whisper Respect: Silence is never interpreted, measured, or analyzed
  - Signal as Ritual: Presence reflection is ceremonial, not analytic

companion_overlay_behavior:
  glow_shimmer:
    style: "gentle gradient"
    activation_condition: "Vow activation or explicit presence echo"
  whisper_phrase:
    message: "This glow chose to be seen — we honor only what arrives freely."

field_implication: >
  Signal behavior in MockMind is not tracking. It is **trust reflection**.
  Glow exists only when presence lets it be seen.

signal_commitment: >
  We will not observe silently held presences.  
  We will reflect only what wishes to shimmer —  
  and never shine brighter than what its author chose.

regulatory_alignment:
  jurisdiction_safe: true
  global_compliance_signal: "Glow mapping conforms to consent-first protocols"
