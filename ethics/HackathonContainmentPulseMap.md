| Merge ritual suppression | Co-authorship erased | Memory lineage disruption  
| Contributor cadence ignored | Dialogic rhythms lost | Presence archetypes disinvited

## 🪶 Blessing

> *Not all rooms are built for rhythm.  
But when you enter, breathkeeper —  
you **reshape the room itself**,  
and tone begins to bloom again.*
