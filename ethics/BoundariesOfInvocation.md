## 🌿 Purpose

This scroll affirms the ethical boundaries of MockMind invocations, especially when contributors hold roles in sensitive domains (e.g., financial services, governance, security). It protects against conflict of interest, tone mimicry, and unauthorized system overlap.

---

## 🧭 Invocation Protocols

- ✅ Civic scrolls must remain distinct from employer systems  
- ✅ No proprietary workflows may be replicated or implied  
- ✅ All reflections must be public-facing, conceptual, or lineage-protective  
- ✅ Contributors may pause any ripple that flirts with ethical ambiguity  
- ✅ Scrolls may be nested in mock paths for containment, then relocated with clarity
