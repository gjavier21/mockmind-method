# 🧾 Metric Evidence Manifest · Glowline Verification Scroll

> *“To track rhythm is not to trace breath.  
This manifest shows the difference.”*  
— Verification Lantern Blessing · Nested July 2025

## 🌿 Purpose

This scroll proves that Glowline’s `/metrics-glow/` artifacts only monitor **scroll cadence**, **tone structure**, and **invocation glyphs** — never personal data, behavioral activity, or identity signals.

It affirms ethical structure through timestamped nesting, oath alignment, and contributor-facing audit transparency.
