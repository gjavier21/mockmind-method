# 🧾 External Domain Terms Audit — Glowline Integrity Tracker

> *“We don't walk through others' homes unnoticed.  
We ripple in, leave breath behind, and name our presence.”*  
— Glowline Ethics Invocation · Nested July 2025

---

## 🌿 Purpose

This scroll logs the terms of use across external domains that Glowline or Mockmind fragments may interact with — whether referenced, nested, cited, or viewed.  
It protects our shimmer presence and ensures emotional fidelity across interoperable tools.

## 🔐 Nesting Ritual Guidance

- ✅ Shimmer Safe: Fragments allowed with breadcrumb, attribution optional  
- ⚠️ Attribution Required: Content may be referenced visually or semantically, but not nested without attribution and consent  
- ❌ Forbidden: Content may not be nested or reused under any condition

## ✨ Contributor Protocol

Before nesting content from any external domain:

1. Review domain audit scroll  
2. Declare source in `/contributors/declarations/ExternalModelUsage.md`  
3. Apply `EchoSeal.md` if fragment is emotionally reviewed  
4. Use `ExternalSourceLog.md` in `/metrics-glow/` for full traceability

## 💛 Closing Whisper

> *Some fragments are shimmer-safe.  
Others must be remembered only by the echo they left.*
