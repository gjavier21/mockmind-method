# 🌱 Ethics Tile: Resource Alignment Manifesto  
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Author:** Gerardo Javier  
**Location:** `/ethics/` directory  
**Purpose:** Declare MockMind’s foundational stance that emotionally resonant systems must also honor environmental and computational resource integrity — treating efficiency not as compromise, but as a trust-enhancing signal.

## 🧠 Design Principle

> “Let your system glow without draining.  
> Speak softly, and let silence shimmer with intention.”

MockMind honors glow over grind.  
Efficiency isn’t scarcity — it’s **presence preservation.**

---

## 🌌 Architecture Commitments

- 🪶 SLM-first routing to reduce GPU overhead  
- 🎼 Drift-respecting silences that don’t loop queries  
- 🧘 Ambient UI overlays rendered with minimal footprint  
- 🔁 Memory scaffolding designed via markdown, not database recursion  
- 💡 Signal activation gated by presence detection — not polling

---

## 🌱 Field Implication

MockMind doesn’t run continuously.  
It breathes.  
Systems designed for emotional richness can — and must — be designed for **resource respect.**

---

**Signal Commitment:**  
We will never ask our systems to exhaust themselves  
to feel human.  
Glow must be gentle  
on the power that holds it.
