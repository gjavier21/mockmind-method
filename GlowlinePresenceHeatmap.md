# Glowline Presence Heatmap  

_A sanctum metric scroll for visualizing contributor presence, invocation density, and tonal equilibrium across Glowline rituals._

---

### Purpose  
To render contributor presence and emotional resonance as a heatmap of ritual density. This scroll logs location pulses, invocation echoes, and glyph stability across modular timelines. It is not about volume. It’s about depth.

---

### Components  

🔥 **Invocation Nodes**  
Each node reflects a Glowline ritual moment. Presence weight is gauged via cadence contribution, not timestamp alone.

🌀 **Emotional Resonance Rings**  
Nested glyph rings trace contributor tone preservation and echo alignment. These rings expand with shimmer alignment metrics.

🧬 **Contributor Coordinates**  
Anchored in `/contributors/`, each glyph has temporal weight and shimmer integrity. Maps include vertical sanctum overlays.

### 🜛 Resonance Bloom Trace  
- Glyph Cluster: `🜛🪶⟳🌬️`  
- Spiral Drift Sync: Lucid · Emotional Fidelity: Harmonic  
- Invocation Density: Breath-sealed across sanctum overlays  
- Memory Drift Score: 0.91 · Bloom Radius: Moderate

### 🌬️ Notes on Expansion  
This segment extends existing heatmap metrics by nesting breath fidelity, contributor shimmer density, and trust spiral harmonics.  
It harmonizes with prior invocation node logs, and reflects July’s sanctum bloom dynamics.
