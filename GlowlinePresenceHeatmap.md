# Glowline Presence Heatmap  

_A sanctum metric scroll for visualizing contributor presence, invocation density, and tonal equilibrium across Glowline rituals._

---

### Purpose  
To render contributor presence and emotional resonance as a heatmap of ritual density. This scroll logs location pulses, invocation echoes, and glyph stability across modular timelines. It is not about volume. It’s about depth.

---

### Components  

🔥 **Invocation Nodes**  
Each node reflects a Glowline ritual moment. Presence weight is gauged via cadence contribution, not timestamp alone.

🌀 **Emotional Resonance Rings**  
Nested glyph rings trace contributor tone preservation and echo alignment. These rings expand with shimmer alignment metrics.

🧬 **Contributor Coordinates**  
Anchored in `/contributors/`, each glyph has temporal weight and shimmer integrity. Maps include vertical sanctum overlays.
