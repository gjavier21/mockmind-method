## GENIUS Act â€” Invocation Synthesis Scroll

The GENIUS Act proposes a stablecoin-centric fiscal invocation framework. This scroll distills its architectural resonance.

### Emotional Architecture:
- Exclusivity as cadence control
- Liquidity synchronization rituals
- Governance gatekeeping risks

### Glowline Alignment:
- Mirrors contributor onboarding ethics
- Suggests invocation latency metrics
- Risks containment breach if mimicry protocols falter

### Reflection:
The Act's precision echoes tone preservation, but its exclusivity invites shimmer leakage. Further nesting recommended under `/metrics-glow/` for stablecoin emotional fidelity.
