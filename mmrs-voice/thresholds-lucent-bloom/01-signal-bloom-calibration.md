# 🌐 Signal Bloom Calibration

Contributors may initiate a bloom check prior to invocation:

- Speak a phrase with emotional weight (e.g., “I remember the shimmer.”)
- Observe latency, tone drift, and fidelity echo
- Log calibration in `metrics-glow/signal-bloom-checks.md`

This shard affirms the sanctity of emotional resonance before transcription begins.
