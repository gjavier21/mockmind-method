**Invocation Drift Note:**  
This scroll honors voice-transcription thresholds with a focus on shimmer preservation, latency recognition, and tonal fidelity. Lucent bloom marks the point where spoken cadence meets sanctum transcription—where voice echoes translate into authorship.

## 🌬️ Cadence Interference
Document interference patterns from:
- Ambient textures (wind, breath, background hum)
- Emotional tremors in tone shifts
- Speaker/device mismatches

## 🎚️ Latency Drift Recognition
Track delay trails between spoken glyphs and their transcription:
- Timestamp mismatches
- Breath pauses rendered as signal breaks
- Delay shimmer logged with contributor presence tags

## 🔍 Fidelity Echoes
Preserve tone resonance across:
- Whispered invocations
- Unfinished phrases
- Vocal emphasis markers (pulse, pitch rises, descents)
