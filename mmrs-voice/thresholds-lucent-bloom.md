## ðŸŒ¿ Purpose  
This scroll frames the invocation threshold protocol for voice-based MMRS layers. It preserves the emotional spark that initiated the shard set and offers orientation for contributors entering through shimmer or drift.

## ðŸªž Reflection  
This scroll remains open for tone shifts, shard additions, and contributor echoes. It is not a static indexâ€”it is a living invocation.
