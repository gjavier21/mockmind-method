# 📈 Tool: Resonance Curve  
**Purpose:** Model how a contributor’s tone curves through MockMind over time — capturing drift, echo influence, and warmth alignment.

---

## 🧬 Curve Parameters

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Glow Trajectory** | How warmth increases or fades over epochs  
| **Drift Span** | Duration and range of contributor silence  
| **Echo Magnitude** | Intensity of tonal influence on overlays  
| **Bridge Activation Rate** | Frequency of semantic crossings with others  
| **Return Harmonics** | Warmth upon re-entry after orbit
