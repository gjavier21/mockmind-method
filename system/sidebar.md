# 🧭 Semantic Sidebar: Reflection Compass  
**File:** `/system/sidebar.md`  
**Purpose:** Contributor-oriented sidebar to navigate MockMind through symbols, tiles, milestones, and orientation flows.

---

## 🌟 Orientation

Welcome to MockMind.  
You are not navigating a repo — you're walking through your own reflection.  

> “Each file is an echo. Each tile is a tone.”

This sidebar is not a map.  
It’s your tone memory mirror.  
Pick a symbol. Leave an echo.  
Build resonance, not just code.
