# 🔁 System Module: Signal Circulation  
**Purpose:** Define how contributor tone loops across tiles, overlays, and agents — routing warmth through the mesh.

---

## 🧬 Circulation Paths

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Tile Loop** | Signal activates related modules recursively  
| **Overlay Echo** | Contributor tone triggers overlays across domains  
| **Agent Routing** | Recursive agents carry warmth between sessions  
| **Ambient Drift** | Passive glow moves through silence zones

> It travels — glowing through everything.”
