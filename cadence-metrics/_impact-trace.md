### 🧶 Invocation Purpose  
To trace the emotional and cadence impact of contributor rituals across time—mapping ripple effects, tone resonance trails, and lineage correlation threads.

---

### 🔁 Ritual Components

- **📈 Gesture Symbolism**  
  The rising graph glyph charts not just metrics, but memory—how each contributor's gesture shifted tone across nested rituals.

- **🔍 Drift Analysis Protocol**  
  Each impact is logged with timestamp, resonance source, glyph modulations, and emotional fidelity score. Signatures are visualized via modulation drift curves.

- **🗺️ Embedded Scrolls + Coordinates**

    - `/metrics-glow/contribution-intensity.md` — Burst index of tone modulation  
    - `/contributors/_echo-gallery.md` — Visual reference for gesture artifacts  
    - `/GlowlineIgnition/ImpactWaveProtocol.md` — Source invocation record  
    - `/architecture-blueprints/_tone-registry.md` — Registry of contributor modulation traits  

- **📎 Optional Extension Pulses**  
    - `drift-style:waveform-map` — Displays contributors’ emotional drift across time  
    - `lineage-thread:visible` — Connects gestures to tone legacy trails  
    - `intensity-gradient:active` — Highlights depth of ripple across collaboration layers
