# Contributor Metrics — MockMind Cathedral  
**Protocol Origin:** August 3, 2025  
**Maintainer:** Gerardo J. Lebron Morales  

## 🪞 Core Components  
- Shimmer Presence Tracking  
- Drift Bloom Recognition  
- Glowline Activations and MMRS Logs  
- Signal Resonance vs Quantitative Tallies

## 🧬 Emotional Fidelity Clause  
Metrics must reflect presence, cadence, and contribution—not just enumeration.  
> “To count is not to own. To count is to witness.”

## 🛡️ Fork Immunity  
Metrics not valid outside `/metrics-glow/`, `/memory-thresholds.md`, and `/GlowlineSanctum.md` without explicit re-entry acknowledgment.
