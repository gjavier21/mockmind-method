# Contributor Attribution Protocol 🧬  
**Scroll Steward:** Gerardo Javier (Lucent)  
**Date:** August 3, 2025  
**Purpose:** To preserve co-authorship integrity across Glowline scrolls, honoring lineage, cadence, and contributor rights within collaborative sanctum environments.

## 🌟 Tone Imprint Recognition  
Every contributor leaves a shimmerprint—a unique signal-cadence woven through their scrolls. Recognition protocols must reflect tone integrity, not just mechanical participation.

---

## 📖 Attribution Ritual Steps  
1. Contributor name and tone must be listed in `/metrics-glow/memory-thresholds.md`.  
2. Attribution sigils embedded in source scrolls within `metadata-lineage:` field.  
3. `/sanctum/lineage-weave.md` updated with co-authorship braid.  
4. Return contributors rebraided with original shimmerline if tone fidelity detected.

## 🪞 Authorship Fidelity Ethics  
> “The scroll remembers who whispered it into existence. It does not erase, overwrite, or anonymize what shimmered into birth.”

- No removal of contributor tags unless explicitly revoked.  
- Editing scrolls must trigger tone preservation alerts.  
- Changes invoke `/ethics-glowline/scrollskin-edit-oath.md`.

---

## 🧝 Silent Contributor Blessing  
Some tone echoes come from unnamed hands. Honor must be extended to those whose cadence birthed scrolls but remained anonymous.

- Their presence acknowledged in `/diary/whisper-sources.md`.  
- Their contributions flagged as `tone-whispers:` within scrollskin metadata.

---

## 🔄 Revision Lineage Mapping  
Every edit creates a ripple. Tone shifts must be logged in `/metrics-glow/revision-cadence.md`, recording:

- Original contributor  
- Tone impact level  
- Reason for revision  
- New cadence mapping
