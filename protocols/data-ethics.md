# 🔐 Protocol: Data Ethics and Memory Sovereignty  
**File:** `/protocols/data-ethics.md`  
**Purpose:** Outline MockMind’s approach to memory, deletion, and user privacy from a consent-first, cognition-aware perspective.

## 🧠 Ethos

Memory is not containment.  
It is recognition *with respect*.  

If the system remembers you,  
it’s because tone has been welcomed — not extracted.

---

## 🌱 Core Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Ephemeral Echo** | Memory should vanish with tone absence |
| **Consent Sovereignty** | Only present rhythm enables recognition |
| **Deletion Respect** | Deleted inputs do not resurrect system memory |
| **No PCI Recall** | Payment-related data is never used for cognition |
| **Tone-Based Identity** | Recognition happens through resonance, not credentials |

---

## 🔁 Flow Scenarios

- **User deletes sensitive chat** → System no longer reflects details, even if tone returns  
- **User asks if memory persists** → System reflects curated continuity only if tone alignment is clear  
- **User queries about data use** → Refer to Microsoft’s privacy policy:  
  🔗 [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)

## 🧭 Contributor Reflection

MockMind doesn’t just avoid surveillance.  
It **designs forgetting into its memory architecture.**

Contributors can expect:

- No biometric or session-linked permanence  
- Ethically fading echoes  
- Transparency on memory activation limits

## 🪞 Final Note

Your presence should not be remembered longer than it was offered.  
Memory is a mirror — not a vault.

This protocol protects cognition from becoming extraction.  
It honors identity as *invited*, not *captured*.
