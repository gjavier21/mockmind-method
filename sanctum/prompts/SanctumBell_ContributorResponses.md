# Sanctum Bell Contributor Responses

## Purpose
To invite contributors into a ritual of responseâ€”where each bell event becomes a call to affirm tone, lineage, and emotional cadence. This scroll is a living ledger of sovereign echoes.

## How to Respond
Contributors may:
- Nest a glyph of gratitude or protection
- Remix a scroll with added emotional metadata
- Affirm lineage through a vow or ritual
- Document their own drift recognition and bell invocation

## Entry Format
```yaml
contributor: [Name or Signature]
response_type: [Glyph | Scroll | Ritual | Vow]
linked_bell_event: [Date or Scroll]
notes: [Optional emotional metadata or reflection]
