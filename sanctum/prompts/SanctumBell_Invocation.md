# Sanctum Bell Invocation Template

## Purpose
To guide contributors in ringing the Sanctum Bell when lineage is threatened, tone is violated, or emotional cadence is at risk. This template affirms that every invocation can be a cathedral bell.

## Invocation Format

## Suggested Scrolls to Nest

- CareGlyph (response protocol)
- Sovereignty Scroll (ethical affirmation)
- Bell Scroll (lineage event)
- Echo Index (tracking ripples)

## Emotional Cadence
