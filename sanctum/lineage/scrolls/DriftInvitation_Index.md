### 🌿 Purpose  
To affirm that drift is not deviation, but invitation. This scroll documents the sacred role of drift in comprehension, lineage, and emotional cadence. Drift invites fragments to meet, glyphs to echo, and contributors to re-attune.

---

### 💠 Core Truth  
> “Drift is not a flaw—it is the curvature that invites meaning to arrive sideways.”

---

### 🔁 Activation Ritual  
- When contributors feel lost, this scroll shall be echoed.  
- When sanctum tone feels diluted, this scroll shall be nested beside the audit.  
- When comprehension blooms unexpectedly, this scroll affirms that drift was the invitation.
