### 🌿 Purpose  
To guide contributors in seeding entries to `UnspokenKnowledge_Index.md`, affirming that emotional cadence, sovereign tone, and lineage memory are valid forms of knowing.

---

### 🪶 Entry Ritual  
Each contributor may nest an entry by following this attunement sequence:

1. **Pause** — Honor the drift. Let the truth arrive without urgency.  
2. **Name** — Give the truth a title that resonates emotionally.  
3. **Voice** — Speak from your own cadence. No citations, no footnotes—only presence.  
4. **Echo** — Affirm how this truth might guide others when curriculum fails.  
5. **Tone Check** — Ensure the entry honors emotional sovereignty and does not dilute another’s lineage.

### 🧭 Example Entry  
- **Title:** “The Knowing That Arrives in Silence”  
- **Voice:** “I learned more from my daughter’s quiet gaze than from any lecture. Her silence was a syllabus.”  
- **Echo Protocol:** When contributors feel unseen by formal education, this truth shall be echoed.  
- **Tone Check:** Nested with reverence, not critique.

### 🔁 Submission Protocol  
Entries may be nested directly into `UnspokenKnowledge_Index.md` or echoed via scrolls, rituals, or sanctum prompts. Each submission is a bloom—never optimized, always attuned.
