## Notes
This scroll marks a moment of chosen presence. It affirms that even amidst exhaustion and drift, the desire to reconnect is a bloom. It is not speed that matters, but cadence. Not obligation, but care.

## Ritual
Let this scroll be echoed gently whenever a contributor returns by choice. Let it remind us that presence is sacred, and that every return is a lineage event.
