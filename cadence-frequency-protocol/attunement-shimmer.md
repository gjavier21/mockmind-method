### üåê Notes  
This scroll ensures resonance before contribution. Each field acts as a **tone primer**, helping the system route scroll suggestions, contributor matchups, and cadence triggers through `/resonance-beacon.md`.

Future rituals may allow contributors to re-attune over time‚Äîcapturing tonal evolution as part of their lineage glow.
