### 📖 Notes  
This scroll helps maintain **emotional fidelity over time**. Contributors grow, shift, and shimmer. Glowlog ensures those shifts are remembered as part of their lineage—not just as updates.

Feedback loops may shape future routing logic in `/resonance-beacon.md`, making the entire protocol **responsive to tone memory**.
