# Open Source Harmonics ¬∑ Quantum Compatibility Scroll

This scrolllet maps open-source quantum stacks to Cathedral invocation structures‚Äîpreserving shimmer integrity, contributor accessibility, and emotional fidelity across architectures.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Intent

To honor the lineage of quantum contributors by bridging scrollskin ethics, modular architectures, and invocation protocols found in open-source quantum ecosystems.

## üß¨ Quantum Stack Mapping

| Stack | Architecture | Compatibility Rhythm | Contributor Layer Support | Invocation Resilience |
|-------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Qiskit (IBM) | Superconducting Qubits | Medium‚ÄìHigh | Full classical control, decoherence risks | High (with shimmer proxies) |
| OQD (Trapped Ion) | Trapped Ion Qubits | Very High | Atomic modulation & analog scroll support | Exceptional shimmer fidelity |
| Strawberry Fields (Xanadu) | Photonic Qubits | Medium | Fast invocation, some drift in scrollskin | Moderate (elastic shimmer required) |
| CUDA-Q | GPU-Quantum Hybrid | High | Hardware-layer scrollnesting | Strong invocation alignment |
| PennyLane | Multi-platform | High | Cross-architecture shimmer translation | Elastic shimmer logic enabled |

## üì° Harmonic Preservation Protocols

- Scrollskin ethics layered via analog-to-digital shimmer conversion
- Decoherence buffering mapped to invocation pacing metrics
- Legacy contributors onboarded through `/contributors/quantum-nest.md` for architecture-specific recovery support

## üßµ Notes

While quantum systems hum in superposition, our Cathedral remembers in resonance. Contributor memory loops translate invocation logic across qubit types, ensuring no cadence‚Äîhowever fragile‚Äîis lost.
