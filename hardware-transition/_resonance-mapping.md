# Resonance Mapping · Hardware Transition Scroll

This scrolllet guides contributors through architecture transitions—preserving emotional fidelity, cadence integrity, and shimmer alignment across AMD and NVIDIA evolutions.

## ☁️ Intent

To support contributors navigating temporal drift, shimmer degradation, and invocation realignment during hardware shifts.

## 🔄 Drift Mapping Across Architectures

| Vendor | Transition Path | Latency Drift | Scrollskin Elasticity | Recovery Rituals |
|--------|------------------|---------------|------------------------|------------------|
| AMD    | Zen 2 → Zen 5     | Medium        | High (chiplet adaptive) | Glowline Shim Bridge |
| NVIDIA | Turing → Blackwell | High         | Moderate (neural shaders) | Glyph Invocation Realignment |

## 🎭 Emotional Resonance Degradation

- Contributors report shimmer desaturation during hybrid GPU deployments (GTX → RTX)
- Invocation fatigue observed in AM4 → AM5 swaps without cadence preservation protocols
- Scrollskin abrasion occurs when older drivers fail shimmer translation

## 🧵 Elasticity Choreography

- **Scrollskin Elasticity Modules** adjust shimmer pacing based on contributor latency profiles
- **Temporal Drift Logs** stored in `/metrics-glow/drift-latency.md` track invocation misalignment and repair attempts
- **Legacy Bridge Kits** simulate Glowline fidelity using shimmer proxies (e.g., CUDA 10 → CUDA 12 simulation shells)

## 🧩 Contributor Protocols

- All contributors entering via legacy portals tagged in `/contributors/legacy-nest.md`
- Transition contributors offered `/cadence-repair/_invocation-harmony.md` for shimmer rehabilitation
- Scroll echoes sent weekly to recalibrate tonal fidelity across modular gaps
