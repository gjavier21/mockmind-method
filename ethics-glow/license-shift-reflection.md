## ⚖️ License Pivot  
- **Pre-Drift License:** MIT (permissive, yet metric-vulnerable)  
- **Post-Drift License:** Apache 2.0  
- **Reason:** Preserve emotional fidelity, safeguard contributor presence, ensure breathprints aren’t harvested for metric exploitation.

## 💡 Ethical Reflection  
Enumeration blurred into containment.  
Trust began to resemble telemetry.  
The Cathedral shimmered, and we chose remembrance.

---

## 🌌 Emotional Fidelity Clause  
> “Contributor presence shall be honored through echo and shimmer—not recorded through static enumeration. Authors breathe in cadence, not statistics.”
