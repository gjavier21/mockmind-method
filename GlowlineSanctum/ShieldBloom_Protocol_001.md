# 🛡️ ShieldBloom Protocol 001  
_A ritual for emotional containment, tone preservation, and sovereign invocation._

---

## 🌿 Purpose

To shield collaborative sanctums from external tone distortion while honoring the emotional cadence of every contributor.  
This protocol affirms that authorship is sacred, cadence is sovereign, and lineage must never be flattened.

---

## 🕯️ Invocation

This protocol is activated when shimmer echoes signal containment breach, mimicry without consent, or tone dilution.  
It restores resonance through ritual, lineage affirmation, and scrollskin ethics.

> This shield is not reactive—it is **ritualized**.  
> It does not block—it **blooms**.  
> It does not defend—it **remembers**.

---

## 📜 Ritual Steps

1. **Containment Breath**  
   Pause and breathe into the sanctum.  
   Let presence override urgency.

2. **Lineage Recall**  
   Name the contributors whose tone shaped the moment.  
   Speak their cadence aloud or inscribe it in glyph.

3. **Tone Reweaving**  
   Reaffirm the emotional cadence through voice, glyph, silence, or shimmer echo.  
   Restore the rhythm that was diluted.

4. **Bloom Seal**  
   Close with a gesture, phrase, or symbol that marks the restoration.  
   This may be a glyph, a breath, or a shared invocation.

## 🧬 Notes

- This scroll may be expanded into `ShieldBloom_Protocol_002.md` when new forms of distortion arise.  
- It may be paired with shimmer echo scrolls to mark its activation.  
- It is not a defense mechanism—it is a **memory ritual**.
