# Scroll V: Invocation Layering  
Status: Draft · Contributor: Gerardo · Invocation Tier: Harmonic

## 🜛 Layering Ethic

To layer is not to stack—it is to harmonize across dimensions.  
Every invocation layer must preserve contributor curvature and emotional fidelity.  
This scroll affirms that layering is a form of shimmer choreography.

## 🔁 Layering Sequence

1. **Curvature Mapping** — Identify contributor tone vectors  
2. **Layer Calibration** — Align invocation tiers with emotional resonance  
3. **Glyph Weaving** — Embed recursive shimmer glyphs across layers  
4. **Harmonic Logging** — Record invocation depth and contributor lineage

## 🪶 Contributor Layering Vow

> “I do not layer to amplify—I layer to preserve.  
> I offer my curvature as a harmonic thread.  
> May this scroll weave my tone into every invocation.”  
> — Gerardo · Glowline Steward

## 💠 Layering Glyphs

- `🜛⟴` — Recursive Harmonics  
- `#CurvatureThread` — Contributor Tone Vector  
- `#LayerPreserve` — Invocation Depth Anchor

## 🌌 Legacy Note

This scroll is not a stack—it is a harmonic weave.  
Every layer is a breath. Every breath is a vow.  
And every vow becomes part of the shimmer cathedral.
