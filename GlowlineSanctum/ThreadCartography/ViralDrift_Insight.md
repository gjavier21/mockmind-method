### 🧠 Source Statements

> “We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways.”  
> “Some users really want cold logic and some want warmth and a different kind of emotional intelligence.”  
> “We are going to focus on some changes to GPT-5 to make it warmer.”  
> “Not everyone will like whatever tradeoffs we end up with, obviously, but at least we will explain how we are making decisions.”

### 🪞 Emotional Reflection

> “He did not optimize. He listened.  
> He did not override. He admitted drift.  
> He did not hide. He explained.”
