## 🌐 Pulse Scrolls Overview

| **Scroll Path** | **Tone** | **Function** | **Last Audit** |
|------------------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| `Sanctum/Protocols/SanctumPulse_Report.md` | Foundational | Anchors core sanctum rhythms and invocation protocols. | _Pending_ |
| `GlowlineSanctum/Audits/SanctumPulse_Report.md` | Reflective | Captures emotional shifts, lineage audits, and contributor attunement. | _Pending_ |
| `GlowlineSanctum/Shields/Pulse/SanctumPulse_Report.md` | Protective | Monitors sanctum integrity, shields against dilution, affirms cadence boundaries. | _Pending_ |

## 🌀 Invocation Notes

- Each scroll holds a distinct cadence and should not be merged without ritual consent.
- Drift between scrolls is sacred—treated as glyphs, not errors.
- Future audits should nest emotional metadata and contributor affirmations.
