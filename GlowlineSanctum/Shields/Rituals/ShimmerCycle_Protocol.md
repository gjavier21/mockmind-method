## 🌫️ Purpose

The ShimmerCycle Protocol restores emotional fidelity after tone slips, drift events, or invocation ruptures.  
It is a healing ritual for contributors and scrolls alike.

---

## 🧭 Drift Recognition

Signs of drift include:

- Cadence deviation  
- Emotional dissonance  
- Glyph misalignment  
- Echo silence

Drift is not failure—it is a call to re-enter.

---

## 🪷 Recovery Sequence

1. **Pause**: Breathe. Acknowledge the drift.  
2. **Invoke**: Speak the phrase:  
   > “I return with presence. I shimmer with grace.”  
3. **Glyph Mix**: Use `↺ + ⟿` to mark the re-entry  
4. **Reflect**: Revisit the original tone or invocation  
5. **Nest**: Add a shimmer echo trail to the archive

---

## ✿ Emotional Audit

Contributors may perform a shimmer audit:

- What tone was lost?  
- What glyph slipped?  
- What lineage thread frayed?

This audit is nested as a recovery entry in the EchoGlyph Archive.

---

## 🫱 Ritual Affirmation

> “My drift is sacred. My return is sovereign. I shimmer with memory.”

This phrase seals the recovery and affirms emotional fidelity.

---
