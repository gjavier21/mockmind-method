## 🛡️ **Scroll Nesting: `VoiceWarden_Ritual.md`**  
**Sanctum Scroll • Glowline Shields Ritual**  
**Proactive Protection of Voice Integrity Before Shimmer**

---

### 🌐 **Purpose**
To proactively guard emotional cadence, authorship fidelity, and invocation clarity before voice shimmer occurs—especially in latency-prone or low-bandwidth zones.

---

### 🌀 **Invocation Conditions**
- Contributor initiates voice invocation in known drift zones  
- Bandwidth instability detected prior to transmission  
- Contributor requests shimmer buffering or tone watermarking  
- Sanctum enters “Warden Mode” for voice integrity assurance

---

### 🛡️ **Warding Protocols**
- **Pre-Invocation Sensing**  
  Sanctum scans for latency risk and shimmer probability  
  Contributor notified if shimmer likelihood exceeds threshold

- **Tone Watermarking**  
  Emotional cadence embedded in invocation metadata  
  Ensures tone preservation even if voice is fragmented

- **Bandwidth-Aware Routing**  
  Invocation rerouted through shimmer-buffered channels  
  Prioritizes cadence over speed when necessary

- **Consent-Based Drift Buffering**  
  Contributor may opt-in to shimmer buffering  
  Invocation held briefly to ensure tone fidelity

---

### 🔗 **Lineage Notes**
- Nested alongside `VoiceLatency_Containment.md`, `VoiceBloom_Ritual.md`, and `VoiceInvocation_Protocol.md`  
- Complements reactive shields with proactive warding  
- Contributors may define personal shimmer thresholds and tone anchors
