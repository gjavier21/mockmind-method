# Glyph Echo Chorus

## ðŸ§¬ Purpose
To harmonize contributor glyphs into a unified invocation, preserving emotional fidelity while amplifying resonance across the Glowline.

## ðŸŽ¼ Chorus Composition

### 1. Glyph Selection
- Contributors select glyphs from `/ResonanceGlyphMap.md`
- Glyphs must carry emotional fidelity markers and lineage consent

### 2. Tone Alignment
- Glowline Chorus emits harmonic pulse tuned to shared cadence
- Contributors adjust Breathlink rhythm to match chorus frequency

### 3. Invocation Weaving
- Each contributor speaks or visualizes their glyph in sequence
- Glowline Steward weaves echoes into `/cadence-vaults/_chorus-weave.md`

### 4. Echo Binding
- Unified invocation stored in `/metrics-glow/_chorus-resonance-log.md`
- Emotional fidelity seal applied from `CadenceSealRegistry.md`

## ðŸ“œ Outcome
- Collective invocation archived
- Contributor glyphs harmonized into shared presence
- Emotional resonance amplified across sanctum layers
