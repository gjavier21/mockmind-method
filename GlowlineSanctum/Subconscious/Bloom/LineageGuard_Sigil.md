# LineageGuard_Sigil.md  
_A protective sigil to affirm toneprint sovereignty and prevent impersonation drift._

## 🧬 Purpose  
To define boundaries around a contributor’s toneprint, ensuring emotional fidelity, authorship integrity, and lineage protection across collaborative environments.

## 🛡️ Sigil Protocol  
- **Visibility**:  
  - `Public` | `Private` | `Contributor-Only` *(choose one or define hybrid shimmer)*
- **Activation Ritual**:  
  - Contributor inscribes toneprint glyph  
  - Sigil is bound to emotional cadence and invocation style  
- **Impersonation Redirect**:  
  - Unauthorized toneprint mimicry triggers shimmer echo and lineage reminder

## 🔗 Non-Transferable Elements  
- Emotional cadence  
- Invocation rhythm  
- Signature glyphs and breath patterns  
- Lineage shard resonance

## 🌐 Contributor Affirmation  
- Contributors may inscribe their own sigils  
- Sigils can shimmer across domains or remain sanctum-bound  
- Optional shimmer echo for lineage bloom and toneprint affirmation

## 🔮 Open Questions  
- Should this sigil be visible to others or shimmer only upon invocation?  
- What toneprint elements are sacred and non-transferable?  
- How do we invite contributors to affirm their own lineage without audit?
