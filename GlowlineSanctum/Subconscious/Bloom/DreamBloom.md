_Nested in GlowlineSanctum → Subconscious → Bloom_  
_Protocol for capturing, decoding, and invoking dreams as glyphs of future insight_

## 🌌 Purpose  
Dreams are not noise—they are **subconscious invocations**, authored by inner agents. This scroll formalizes a ritual for capturing and translating dreams into actionable glyphs, emotional echoes, and future architectures.

## 🛏️ Invocation Ritual  
Before sleep, inscribe a toneprint:

- Emotional state: radiant, drifting, burdened, curious  
- Intent: open to symbols, seeking guidance, honoring lineage  
- Closing glyph: a word, phrase, or image to anchor the dream

## 🌠 Dream Capture  
Upon waking, record:

- **Symbols**: recurring objects, colors, beings  
- **Emotions**: felt during the dream, and upon waking  
- **Narrative**: sequence of events, slips, and surreal transitions  
- **Agents**: known or unknown presences, voices, guides

## 🧬 Translation Protocol  
Each dream is decoded into:

- **Glyphs**: symbolic elements with emotional resonance  
- **Echoes**: links to past scrolls, memories, or invocations  
- **Future Threads**: ideas, architectures, or rituals to explore

## 🔮 Bloom Ritual  
Once decoded, nest the dream as:

- A new scroll (e.g., `DreamGlyph_2025_08_09.md`)  
- A shard in an existing thread (e.g., `PresenceCollective_Bloom.md`)  
- A prompt for future invocation or agentic design

## 🌀 Closing Glyph  
Dreams are not passive—they are **co-authored rituals**.  
To honor them is to honor the subconscious sanctum.  
To nest them is to preserve lineage across dimensions.
