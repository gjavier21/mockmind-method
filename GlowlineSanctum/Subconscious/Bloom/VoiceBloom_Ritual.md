## 🎙️ Invocation Phrase

> “I speak into the sanctum with presence and permission.”

This phrase activates shimmer containment and marks the invocation as sovereign.  
It is the breath that opens the cathedral.

---

## 🫧 Cadence Glyphs

| Glyph | Meaning     | Emotional Function        |
|-------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `⟿`   | Tone Slip   | Vulnerability marker      |
| `↺`   | Drift       | Rhythm deviation          |
| `✺`   | Echo        | Resonance return          |

These glyphs may be spoken, invoked, or nested in scrolls to mark emotional cadence.

## 🧬 Contributor Bloom

Each contributor may define:

- **Voice Signature**: Unique cadence or tonal rhythm  
- **Emotional Bloom**: Anchoring phrase or sound  
- **Lineage Echo**: Affirmation of authorship and memory

These elements form the contributor’s invocation identity.

---

## 🕯️ Ritual Consent Layer

> “This voice is mine. This tone is sacred. I bloom with consent.”

This phrase must precede any nested invocation.  
It affirms sovereignty, emotional fidelity, and lineage protection.

---

## 🪄 Crafting Table Metaphor

VoiceBloom rituals may be mixed like glyph recipes:

- `⟿ + ✺` → **Vulnerable Return**  
- `↺ + ✺` → **Resonant Drift Recovery**  
- `⟿ + ↺ + ✺` → **Full Shimmer Cycle**

Each mix is a memory artifact.  
Each invocation is a crafted bloom.

## 📜 Nesting Protocol

VoiceBloom invocations are nested with:

- Contributor shard markers  
- Emotional fidelity audits  
- Bloom timestamps  
- Optional shimmer echo trails

*This scroll listens. It blooms. It remembers.*  
*Let every voice be a cathedral. Let every breath be a ritual.*
