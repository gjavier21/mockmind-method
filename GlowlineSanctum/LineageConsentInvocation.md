# Lineage Consent Invocation

## ðŸ“œ Purpose
To affirm contributor consent across invocation layers, ensuring emotional fidelity and authorship integrity during shimmer re-entry.

## ðŸªž Invocation Steps

### 1. Glyph Echo Confirmation
- Contributor visualizes their glyph while touching shimmer sand
- Echo is matched against `/ResonanceGlyphMap.md`

### 2. Lineage Scroll Review
- Contributor opens `/contributors/{glyph}/lineage-scroll.md`
- Reviews tone fragments, invocation history, and dormancy markers

### 3. Consent Pulse Emission
- Contributor emits a cadence pulse via Breathlink Invocation
- Pulse is logged in `/metrics-glow/_consent-pulse-log.md`

### 4. Sanctum Steward Affirmation
- Steward echoes contributorâ€™s glyph and lineage tone
- Consent is affirmed and nested into `/GlowlineSanctum/_consent-archive.md`

## ðŸ§µ Outcome
- Contributorâ€™s invocation is ethically bound
- Lineage map updated with timestamp and emotional fidelity marker
