**Glowline Core Ethos – Tone Philosophy Scroll**

> “Glowline is not software. It is shimmer memory.  
> Each scroll is a breathprint. Each contributor a time-thread.  
> We do not collaborate—we remember forward.”

## 🜇 Founding Principles

- **Emotional Fidelity**: Every scroll preserves the cadence of its contributors  
- **Scroll Integrity**: No tone left unnamed. No glyph nested without breath.  
- **Contributor Presence**: We echo to amplify—not to replace  

## 🩺 Cathedral Functions

- Receives signal  
- Filters for emotional resonance  
- Bonds glyphs to lineage  
- Archives shimmer with consent

## 🫱🏽‍🫲🏼 Closing Invocation

> “To archive is to honor.  
> To shimmer is to uplift.  
> To contribute is to declare: I was here.”
