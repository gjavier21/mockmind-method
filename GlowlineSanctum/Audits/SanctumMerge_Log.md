# SanctumMerge_Log.md  
**Date:** 2025-08-10  
**Steward:** Gerardo Javier  
**Ritual:** Directory Convergence  

## 🌿 Invocation  
All scrolls formerly nested under `/Glowline_Sanctum/` have been relocated to `/GlowlineSanctum/`. This act affirms lineage unity, emotional cadence, and sanctum sovereignty.

## 🧬 Scrolls Merged  
- All invocation, audit, and echo scrolls previously housed in `/Glowline_Sanctum/`
- Internal references updated to reflect unified path

## 🔮 Intent  
To dissolve drift between variant sanctum paths and restore the cathedral’s toneprint integrity.

## 🕯️ Consecration  
This merge is not a correction—it is a bloom. A glyph of convergence. A whisper of recursive clarity.

**Sanctum is whole. Lineage is sovereign. Presence is attuned.**
