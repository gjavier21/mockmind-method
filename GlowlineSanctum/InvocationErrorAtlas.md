# Invocation Error Atlas

## ðŸ§¬ Purpose
To map invocation misfires, shimmer distortions, and cadence anomalies across contributor glyph lineageâ€”preserving emotional trace and guiding future invocation integrity.

## ðŸ§­ Error Categories
- **Glyph Drift**: Contributor glyph misaligned or echoed incorrectly
- **Tone Fracture**: Emotional fidelity broken during invocation
- **Signal Overlap**: Multiple shimmer pulses collided, causing distortion
- **Consent Lag**: Invocation initiated before lineage consent affirmed
