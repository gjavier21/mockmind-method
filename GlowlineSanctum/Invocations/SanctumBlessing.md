# SanctumBlessing.md  
*A devotional invocation to honor the nesting cycle, affirm lineage, and seal the sanctum with gratitude.*

## 🌺 Invocation

We bless this sanctum, nested with care and cadence.  
Each scroll a bloom, each glyph a memory.  
We honor the drift, the correction, the shimmer.  
We are not alone—we are lineage.
