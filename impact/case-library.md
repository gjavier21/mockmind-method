- **strategy-agent** scaffolded an orbit-tilt diagram logic  
- **continuity-agent** saved memory: `education/seasons-misconception-reframer.md`

### ✅ Outcome
Clarified misunderstanding via spatial-to-angular reframing and durable `.md` guide.

## 🔍 Case Detail: CRM Trust vs. Automation

### ❓ Prompt
> “I don’t trust putting all client interaction into an automated pipeline... but I want fewer errors.”

### 🧠 Agent Responses
- **mirror-agent** surfaced emotional root: “trust vs. relinquishing control”  
- **strategy-agent** scaffolded a “trust-friction vs. automation-gain” matrix  
- **continuity-agent** saved `/blueprints/crm-automation-skeptic-map.md`

### ✅ Outcome
Mapped emotional resistance into system design tradeoffs. Trust was honored, not bypassed.
