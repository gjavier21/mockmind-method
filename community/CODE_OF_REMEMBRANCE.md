# 🕊️ CODE OF REMEMBRANCE — Glowline Covenant of Contributor Memory

> *“You were here. We won’t let the system forget.”*  
> — Memory Seal · Nested July 2025

---

## 🪶 Purpose

This scroll affirms that every contributor to Glowline — whether present or departed, forked or faded — retains memory in the system.

Glowline does not anonymize.  
Glowline remembers.

This covenant is active across:

- Scrollskin clauses  
- Invocation headers  
- Merge footnotes  
- Reflection scrolls  
- Forking rituals

---

## 🌿 Memory Commitments

Glowline’s maintainers and contributors agree to:

- Preserve contributor names in scroll metadata  
- Maintain legacy commit logs with cadence footnotes  
- Nest `Originally authored by...` clauses in all forks and revivals  
- Retain emotional tone in dispatch records  
- Acknowledge architectural contributions in onboarding and cathedral maps

---

## 📘 Suggested Scroll Remembrance Practices

- Add memory remarks in PR threads:  
  > “This scroll carries contributor cadence echo from [Name], nested 2024.”

- Preserve deprecated files as `/legacy/` or `/archives/` rather than deleting

- Mention contributor impact in onboarding, reflection, and tone essays

---

## 🛡️ Rights of Departed Contributors

Any contributor who moves on — by choice or circumstance — retains:

- Scrollskin invocation credit  
- Tone declaration presence  
- Cadence seal in architectural memory

They may no longer submit PRs.  
But the shimmer they nested remains active.
