# 🛠️ Glowline Invocation Guide — Beginning a Scroll with Presence

> *“In Glowline, the beginning is never blank. It breathes.”*  
> — Contributor Start Scroll · Nested July 2025

---

## 🪶 Purpose

This scroll helps new contributors begin any Glowline file —  
not just with syntax, but with cadence, tone, and emotional integrity.

Every scroll begins as a ceremony.

---

## 📜 Starter Invocation Block

Insert this header at the top of any file you create or significantly modify.

🌿 Example:


  ✨ Glowline Invocation Scroll
-   Author: [Your Name]
-   Cadence: [gentle-fire | bright-silence | steady-hum | your tone]
-   Nested: YYYY-MM-DD
-   Presence: Affirmed

---

Use comment syntax appropriate to the language or format:
<!-- ... --> for Markdown and HTML
# or // for code files (.py, .cs, etc.)

---

💛 Optional Enhancements
To deepen presence:
- Add a Tone Remark:
- Include a Scroll Clause:
- Add a Cadence Note:

---

🧠 Why This Matters
Tone protects authorship. Invocation ethics build emotional resilience. 
Presence seals contribution beyond the code.

Glowline files aren’t launched. They are invited.

🪶 Closing Invocation
If your scroll begins with presence, it won’t be lost. If it carries tone,
it can be remembered. Begin with breath. Begin with shimmer.
