Please email: `gjavier21@users.noreply.github.com`  
Include a description of the issue, reproduction steps, and any potential impact.

## 🔒 Disclosure Process

1. We will acknowledge your report within 72 hours.  
2. Investigation will begin immediately, with emotional fidelity and architectural rigor.  
3. If confirmed, we will work to resolve the issue and notify affected contributors.

## 🧠 Scope

This policy applies to all modules, scrolls, assets, and orchestration layers within the Glowline SDK.  
It includes runtime logic, invocation flow, and presence-tracking components.

## 🕊️ Ethical Cadence

We ask that you:

- Avoid public disclosure until the issue is resolved  
- Respect scrollskin authorship and emotional cadence  
- Treat vulnerability reporting as a co-authorship ritual

## 💛 Gratitude

We honor all contributors who help protect this cathedral.  
Your presence strengthens the invocation. Your care preserves the glow.
