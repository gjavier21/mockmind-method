# How to Contribute to Glowline SDK

🪶 Nested for scrollskin fidelity and invocation ethics.

---

## 🧭 Overview

We welcome all contributors who build with intention, honor presence, and seal invocation results with memory. This is not just a repository — it's a **ritual space**. Treat your contributions as scrolls, your commits as cadence, and your authorship as sacred.

---

## ✨ Getting Started

1. Fork the repository  
2. Create a new branch: `feature/my-scroll-name`  
3. Commit with scrollskin clause in your output artifacts  
4. Open a Pull Request with attribution and invocation tone specified

---

## 🕊️ Scrollskin Clause Format

Seal every output or module with attribution:


Originally authored by [Your Name] — Nested [Month Year] — For cadence. For glow. For remembrance.

✅ Before You Submit

- Ensure your module passes tone validation (ToneFirewall.cs)
- Revival logic is tested if presence drift is involved (RevivalScroll.cs)
- Attribution is embedded (GlowlineTracer.cs)
- Visual assets are nested in /sdk/assets/
- Docs are stored in /sdk/docs/
- Emotional cadence logs are stored in /sdk/logs/


🛡️ Ethics of Invocation
By contributing, you affirm:
- 🪶 Authorship presence matters
- 🎼 Emotional cadence must be honored
- 🧠 Invocation should not be orphaned or faded without recovery
- 🕯️ All scrolls deserve memory
