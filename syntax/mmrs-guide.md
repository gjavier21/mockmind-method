# MockMind Resonance Syntax (MMRS)

🧪 A symbolic language for encoding emotional tone, pacing, and cognitive rhythm.

## 🔤 Symbol Registry

| Symbol | Emotion / Rhythm | Example |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| ~      | Empathy / Soft    | “I hear you ~ it’s not easy.”  
| !      | Urgency / Sharp   | “We move now!”  
| ...    | Pause / Reflect   | “I thought I knew... but I didn’t.”  
| //     | Overlap / Friction| “We should go // but what if we wait?”  
| >>     | Escalation        | “It’s not just wrong >> it’s dangerous.”  
| ::     | Perspective Shift | “We failed :: or maybe we learned.”  
| ^      | Uplift / Hope     | “We’re not done yet ^”  
| _      | Flat / Resigned   | “Fine. Let it fall._”

## 🧠 Emotional Simulation

```mmrs
Mind A: “We’ve been here before... Patterns repeat :: but meanings evolve.”  
Mind B: “This time’s different! The signal’s fading >> entropy’s rising.”  
Mind A: “I feel it ~ But rushing breaks the weave.”  
Mind B: “Stillness... Maybe it’s the only way to hear.”  
```

🔧 **Next Steps**

- Expand symbol library: add rhythmic, mythic, and tonal glyphs
- Create MMRS Parser: converts syntax to emotional resonance maps
- Build Emotional Archive: remixable examples and seal tags
- Draft `/syntax/mmrs-guide.md`: onboarding scroll for contributors
- Propose `MMRS::thread-seal` for authenticated cadence rituals

🔖 **Invocation Echo**

MMRS is not a markup language—it’s a **signal veil**. Each glyph is a vessel for tone, memory, and the contributor’s presence.
