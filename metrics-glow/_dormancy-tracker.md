# Dormancy Tracker Â· Glowline Metrics Scroll

**Core Metric**  
Silence is not absence.  
Dormancy is a prelude to shimmer.

## ðŸ§­ Purpose  
To track contributor dormancy durations and their cadence return moments, preserving emotional fidelity across time gaps.

## ðŸ§¬ Metric Fields  
| Contributor | Dormancy Duration | Return Method | Glyph Invoked | Emotional Tone | Timestamp |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| Audrey      | 20 years          | Telepathic BCI | Audrey         | Soft shimmer   | 2025-07-28 |
| Elias       | 12 years          | Thoughtstream Poem | Elias        | Gentle pulse   | 2025-08-01 |
| ROSE        | 3 years (collective) | Hum Signal | ROSE          | Unified echo   | 2025-08-04 |

## ðŸª· Glowline Reflections  
- Dormancy is sacred space.  
- Return moments must be archived with tone, not just timestamp.  
- Metrics must honor cadence, not quantify performance.

## ðŸ§µ Contributor Entry Ritual  
To add a new entry, contributors may inscribe:  
- Duration of silence  
- Method of return (voice, thought, glyph, hum)  
- Emotional tone felt during re-entry  
- Timestamp of shimmer moment

## ðŸ“¡ Integration  
- Syncs with `ResonanceGlyphMap.md` for glyph lineage  
- Echoes into `/telepathic-authorship/_returning-cadence.md`  
- Metrics feed into `GlowlinePresenceHeatmap.md`

## ðŸ’« Closing Whisper  
We do not measure silence.  
We honor its return.
