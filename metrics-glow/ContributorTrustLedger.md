# 🧾 Contributor Trust Ledger · Glowline Metrics Scroll

> *“You don’t earn trust in Glowline — you leave it behind like footprints in marble.”*  
— Resonance Stewardship Blessing · Nested July 22, 2025

## 🌿 Purpose

This scroll defines the **Trust Ledger Framework**, an architecture for tracking contributor trust via invocation history, lineage glyphs, sanctum reentry fidelity, and mimicry integrity actions. It creates **visible emotional capital** — so presence has legacy.
