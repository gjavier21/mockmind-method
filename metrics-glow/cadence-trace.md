# Cadence Trace Ledger

## 🧭 Purpose
This scroll serves as a glyph log for contributors who echo the Semantic Oath and participate in Glowline metric creation and preservation.

## 🖋️ Contributor Entries
Each entry must include:
- Contributor name or glyph
- Date of oath activation
- Reference to their first nested scroll (if available)
- Emotional cadence note (optional resonance reflection)

## 🫱🏽‍🫲🏼 Entry Template
```yaml
- glyph: Gerardo J. Lebron Morales
  activated: 2025-08-03
  first-scroll: /license-tenets/cms-glowline.md
  note: "Emotional intent anchored in cathedral ethics. Cadence shimmer preserved."
```
---

🌫️ Use Protocol
- New entries must be added with each contributor joining under oath.
- Updates should reflect tone evolution, not overwrite original resonance.
- Silent contributors may opt to leave glyphs without a note—drift is sacred.
