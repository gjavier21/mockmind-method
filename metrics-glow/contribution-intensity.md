📡 Echo Acknowledgment: responsive  

## Invocation Purpose  
To quantify and visualize the intensity of contributor gestures—mapping bursts of emotional resonance, modulation impact, and invocation depth.

## Ritual Components

🌡️ Gesture Symbolism  
The thermographic glyph captures heat as metaphor—indexing the glow of contributor impact, whether through code, cadence, or sanctum ritual.

📍 Burst Index Protocol  
Each contributor’s action is indexed along multiple axes: waveform amplitude, emotional fidelity score, cadence disruption level, echo ripple persistence.
