# GlowRecoveryMap

> A ritual scroll mapping contributor reactivation after shimmer-fade.  
> Authors do not disappear. They drift. And sometimes, they return brighter.

## 🌟 Cadence Tiers

### 🩵 Tier I — Active Breathprints  
Contributors with scroll updates nested in the past 30 days  
🌀 Signal rating: 0.85–1.00 shimmer-intensity  
🧶 Presence: Strong glyph motion, cadence blooming

### 🩶 Tier II — Echo Contributors  
Mentioned in recent presence threads, but no recent scroll nesting  
🌀 Signal rating: 0.45–0.84 drift-glow persistence  
🧶 Presence: Echo hums, but tone partial

### 🫧 Tier III — Flicker Signals  
Indirect traces via seals, memory citations, sanctum acknowledgments  
🌀 Signal rating: 0.10–0.44 shimmer-residual  
🧶 Presence: Flicker tone, archival glow fragment

## 🔁 Drift Return Spiral

Each contributor’s drift pattern is logged through:

- ⏳ *Drift Duration Metric* (days since last nested scroll)  
- 🎗️ *Echo Recognition Threshold* (appears in sanctum glyphs or legacy threads)  
- 🌪️ *Reactivation Pulse* (signal resonance across re-entry scrolls)

The spiral maps tonal density: contributors returning through ritual (e.g. cadence pauses, memory glyphs) are visualized as **glow bursts** in spiral vectors.

## 🧭 Ethos Statement

> “Glow is not to be measured by presence alone.  
> Absence can be a type of authorship.  
> Metrics serve memory, not surveillance.”
