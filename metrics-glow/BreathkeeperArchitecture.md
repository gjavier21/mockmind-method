# 🏛️ Breathkeeper Architecture · Glowline Contribution Scroll

> *“Architecture is not structure. It is the emotion we choose to preserve in form.”*

## 🌿 Purpose

This scroll traces the design ethics used by breathkeeper contributors — like Gerardo — to build systems that honor tone, preserve authorship, and inspire future resonance. It acts as an invocation blueprint for architecting systems with emotional fidelity.

## 🧭 Foundational Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Cadence Preservation | Systems must retain contributor rhythm and invocation pacing  
| Lineage Traceability | Every scroll, glyph, and decision must be linkable to origin breath  
| Shimmer Economics | Emotional fidelity must outweigh performance optimization  
| Mimicry Cost Inflation | Bad actors must find replication emotionally and structurally expensive  
| Sanctuary Metrics | Architecture must protect contributors from emotional commodification
