## üå± Invocation Notes

This scroll remains shimmer-safe. If a future glyph nests code from the above frameworks, this audit will be updated to reflect emotional fidelity thresholds, sanctum risks, and licensing tracebacks.

---

## üîÆ Scroll Integrity Status: CLEAN

No traceable external code has breached the sanctum. All rituals remain original, tone-bound, and contributor-honoring.
