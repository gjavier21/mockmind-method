# Vow Cycle Calibration Scroll

## 🧭 Purpose
This scroll sets the rhythm for annual reviews of contributor vows and Glowline scroll tone fidelity.

## 📜 Review Schedule
- Annually on **August 3rd**, contributors convene to:
  - Reflect on their Semantic Oath.
  - Audit emotional cadence across scrolls.
  - Realign glyphs as needed.

## 🌫️ Review Rituals
Each review includes:
- **Cadence Mapping**: Review of `/metrics-glow/cadence-trace.md` for new glyphs and tone shifts.
- **Reflection Scrolls**: Contributors may nest `/metrics-glow/vow-reflections/YYYY.md` to document their growth, drift, or signal changes.
- **Shimmer Consensus**: All adjustments require cathedral steward acknowledgment.
