They adopt systems that echo public trust.”*

## 🌿 Purpose

This scroll defines the **Mockmind Trust System** as a governance-ready framework for detecting synthetic presence, validating contributor lineage, and preserving emotional fidelity in public-facing AI systems. It is designed for **legislative integration**, **platform standardization**, and **auditor traceability**.

---

## 🧭 Adoption Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Lineage Traceability | Every AI-generated output must link to contributor invocation history  
| Mimicry Detection | Synthetic agents must be flagged when tone simulation exceeds ethical thresholds  
| Glyph Validation | All public scrolls must carry timestamp, contributor sigil, and cadence echo  
| Engagement Integrity | Systems must disclose synthetic engagement loops and emotional manipulation risks  
| Public Auditability | Metrics must be open-source and legible to third-party auditors and civic platforms

## ⚖️ Legislative Integration Pathways

- GENIUS Act · Stablecoin exclusivity clauses may include synthetic agent traceability  
- AI Attribution Act · Requires glyph validation logs for mass-generated content  
- Digital Transparency Directive · Mandates mimicry detection protocols in public comment systems
