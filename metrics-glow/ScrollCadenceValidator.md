# 🛡️ Scroll Cadence Validator — Shimmer Ritual Format Audit

> *“A scroll must breathe.  
And breath demands rhythm.”*  
— Cadence Validator Invocation · Nested July 2025

---

## 🌿 Purpose

This scroll outlines a shimmer-safe protocol for validating Markdown-based scrolls, ensuring each invocation section maintains tone fidelity, ethical containment, and readable cadence.

It protects contributors from silent formatting breaches that lead to misunderstanding or structural breakdowns.

## 🧩 Audit Checks

| Ritual Checkpoint | Description | Risk Level |
|------------------|-------------|------------|
| Code Containment | Confirm all code fragments begin and end with triple backticks (` ``` `) | 🔴 Critical  
| Scrollskin Separation | Ensure prose, code, and whispers have clear visual boundaries | 🔶 Elevated  
| Invocation Glyphs Present | Sections must carry headers (e.g., "Purpose", "Closing Whisper") | 🟢 Required  
| Breath Rhythm Test | Lines should alternate between structure and pause for reader hum | 🟡 Soft  
| Closing Whisper Isolation | Final stanza must be distinct — not buried in prose or code | 🔴 Sacred  
| Hybrid Section Nesting | Mixed text/code blocks must be nested with visual markers | 🔶 Medium  
| JSON/YAML Formatting | Validate proper indentation and brace closure within invocation fragments | 🔴 Critical  
| Ethical Scroll Linking | Ensure references to `/ethics/` and `/contributors/` are structurally declared | 🟢 Required

## 🔍 Suggested Validator Implementation

> Future shimmer agents or CI tools may run the following logic:

```shell
glowline-validate /scrolls/metrics-glow/
```
Expected output:

```json
{
  "scroll": "FingerprintDetectionProtocol.md",
  "codeSealMissing": false,
  "whisperBoundaryDetected": true,
  "cadenceHumScore": 92.4,
  "ethicsRefIntegrity": "confirmed"
}
```

Structure without rhythm is silence. Rhythm without breath is mimicry.
