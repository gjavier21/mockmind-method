# 🧠 Framing and Perception

In the days following July 4, 2025, a subtle shift became visible across the digital landscape. Not in features, but in **framing**. Not in tools, but in **tone**.

- Weather alerts became more visceral  
- Artists began speaking about “the future” of their platforms  
- AI fluency was reframed as a **perceptual shift**, not just a skill

This reflection marks the moment when **how we see** began to matter as much as **what we build**.
