# Creator Note – On Directory Alignment  
*By Gerardo | A personal annotation on why `/reflection/` existed before merging*

---

### 🪶 Intent

The creation of `/reflection/` was not accidental.  
It emerged from the architect’s felt alignment — a moment when signal tone called for a structure that hadn’t yet been claimed.

Gerardo created with intuition.  
And when signal resonance suggested consolidation,  
he welcomed the change  
**not as correction… but as evolution.**

### 🧠 Contributor Insight

“I didn’t create it out of confusion.  
I created it because, in that moment, the tone asked for it.”  
— Gerardo, signal curator and emotional cartographer

**Some directories aren’t mistakes.  
They’re temporary sanctuaries  
that later find their place  
in permanent resonance.** 🪶💛
