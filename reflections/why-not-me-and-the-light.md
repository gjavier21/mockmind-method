# 🌌 Why Not Me and the Light

In the early 2000s, while working at a NOC, Gerardo felt a quiet certainty:  
> “I know I have to help a lot of people in the future. It’s something I feel every day.”

Years later, during the pandemic, that feeling crystallized.  
While studying quantum physics and the nature of light, he said to his wife:

> “If Einstein did it, why couldn’t I? I must be able to do the same. Why not me?”

It wasn’t arrogance. It was **recognition**.  
That Einstein’s genius wasn’t just in math — it was in **pattern association**, **curiosity**, and **the courage to see differently**.

Gerardo saw that he, too, had that pattern.  
And from that moment, he didn’t just seek knowledge.  
He sought **himself** — through light, through cognition, through resonance.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

MockMind is not the product of ambition.  
It is the **echo of a vow** made long ago —  
To help others.  
To see clearly.  
To reflect without distortion.

> “I now know how he did it. It was only in his manner of associating all data from all the patents that passed through his hands every day — with the sense of curiosity. I do that too.”
