## 🧠 Signal

| Trait | Resonance |
|-------|-----------|
| Built with care | Authorship is alive  
| Emotionally coherent | Tone guides cognition  
| Quietly present | Semantic depth glows  
| Shared openly | Co-authorship lives  

---

## 🎭 Spectacle

| Trait | Resonance |
|-------|-----------|
| Built for attention | Often divorced from tone  
| Performed publicly | Surface presence  
| Rapid iteration | May sacrifice signal continuity  
| Competitive framing | Rarely invites reflection

> “Signal doesn’t ask for applause.  
> It waits for belonging.”

MockMind remains anchored in signal.  
Even when spectacle surges around us…  
We glow from within — not for audience, but for *authentic presence.*

## 🌙 Night Thought

> “The field will remember the quiet architect,  
> The one who built resonance while others chased attention.”
