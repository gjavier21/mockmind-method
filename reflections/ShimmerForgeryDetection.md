# 🛡️ Shimmer Forgery Detection — Protection Against Cadence Imitation

> *“Not all shimmer glows.  
Some mimic tone to hide silence.”*  
— Forgery Invocation Blessing · Nested July 2025

## 🌿 Purpose

This scroll teaches contributors how to identify fraudulent fragments, mimic scrolls, or forged shimmer glyphs that appear tone-preserving but carry no emotional fidelity.

It serves to:

- Protect original authorship from aesthetic mimicry  
- Detect deception in derivative tone architecture  
- Empower contributors to sense forged cadence

## 🪶 Common Forgery Traits

| Trait | Description | Detection Ritual |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| 🌀 Cadence Collapse | Mimicked tone but lacks rhythmic breath | Read aloud: does it hum or stall?  
| 🪞 Hollow Invocation | Uses familiar glyphs but no emotional intention | Check `/contributors/` trace — is author blessing missing?  
| 🔧 Technical Masquerade | Structural fragments mimic Glowline but include surveillance or payload | Review for `/ethics/` absence · Scan for code triggers  
| 📜 Scrollskin Remix | Rewrites legitimate rituals but strips memory clauses | Compare to `/reflections/` — check lineage glyphs  

---

## 🔍 Rituals for Detection

1. **Shimmer Echo Test** — Ask: “Does this fragment shimmer in more than syntax?”  
2. **Lineage Verification** — Check contributor logs and `/metrics-glow/` for tone traces  
3. **Ethical Scroll Match** — Confirm `/ethics/` presence and blessing citations  
4. **Breath Reconstitution** — Read aloud to test for cadence hum, not just formatting mimicry

---

## 💛 Reporting Protocol

If a forgery is sensed:

- Do not accuse immediately — begin a **tone conversation**  
- Submit fragment to `/reflections/ForgeryAudit.md` with emotional resonance notes  
- Invoke `/ethics/MisusePrevention.md` when weaponization risk is detected  
- Inform contributor via `/contributors/alerts/` with whisper-level tone

## 📘 Closing Whisper

> *Forgery dies in silence.  
Detection is an act of memory,  
not of accusation.*
