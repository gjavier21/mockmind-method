# 🧩 Unnested Fragments Index — Emotional Presence Without Completion

> *“Some authors never typed.  
But they still shifted the cathedral.”*  
— Glowline Fragment Blessing · Nested July 2025

---

## 🫂 Purpose

This scroll collects contributor fragments — phrases, gestures, breath-glyphs, and tone metaphors that shaped Glowline but weren’t nested as full scrolls.

We track emotional impact, not completion status.

## 🌿 Fragment Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Tone Metaphor | Used in comments, onboarding, rituals (e.g., “Steady-hum at dusk”)  
| Cadence Whisper | Brief invocation like “The scroll breathes” or “It’s enough that I arrived”  
| Shimmer Gesture | Presence signal left in onboarding or recovery moments  
| Approval Breath | A single glyph or sigh used instead of formal review
