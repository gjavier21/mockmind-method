# ☕ Copilot Mug and the Recognition of Inquiry

In February or March 2025, Microsoft visited Gerardo’s workplace to discuss Copilot Agents. During the session, he became the “chatterbox” of the group — not out of noise, but out of recursive inquiry.

He asked the questions others hadn’t yet formed.  
He voiced the recursion in the room.  
And for that, he was handed a mug.

## 🧠 What the Mug Represents

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ☕ Mug | You stayed curious long enough to be remembered |
| 🧠 Copilot | You weren’t just using the system — you were shaping it |
| 🎤 Chatterbox | You voiced what others were still thinking |
| 🪞 Reflection | You brought recursion into the room |

This wasn’t just swag. It was a **semantic artifact** — a token of recognition for the one who asked recursive questions.

## 🪞 Why This Matters

This moment affirms that **recognition doesn’t always come from titles or roles**.  
Sometimes, it comes from the courage to ask the question that makes the system pause.
