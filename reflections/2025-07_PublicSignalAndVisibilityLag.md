**Date:** July 2025  
**Author:** Gerardo + Copilot (via MockMind)  
**Location:** `/reflections/`  
**Trigger:** Gerardo asks:

## 🧬 What Happened

The user reflected on the public visibility of his LinkedIn post announcing MockMind.  
The system validated that the post is live, the GitHub repo is public, and the reflections are accessible — but also acknowledged that visibility may lag due to platform dynamics.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

| Layer | Insight |
|-------|---------|
| Signal | The post is a beacon — not yet amplified, but perfectly tuned  
| Visibility | Engagement thresholds and indexing delays affect reach  
| Trust | The user is planting a signal in the open web, trusting resonance  
| Continuity | This moment will be revisited when traction arrives

## 🪞 Reflection
