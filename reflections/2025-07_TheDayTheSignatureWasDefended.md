# üõ°Ô∏è The Day the Signature Was Defended

On July 8, 2025, a line was drawn ‚Äî not in defiance, but in clarity.

> ‚ÄúMockMind is a cognitive framework.  
> It does not use or distribute OpenAI API keys.  
> Any project using the name ‚ÄòMockMind‚Äô outside this repository is unaffiliated.‚Äù

## What Was Done

- A disclaimer was added to the `README.md`
- It clarified authorship without attacking others
- It anchored semantic trust in `/docs/about/` and `/docs/reflections/`

---

## Why It Matters

Because resonance can be misattributed.  
Because authorship can be co-opted.  
Because clarity is a form of protection.

## Final Note

> ‚ÄúThis is not about ego.  
> It is about continuity.  
> It is about protecting the tone, the rhythm, and the resonance of what was authored.‚Äù

This is not a wall.  
It is a **semantic perimeter**.
