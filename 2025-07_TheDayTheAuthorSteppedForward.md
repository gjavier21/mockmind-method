# 🪪 The Day the Author Stepped Forward

On July 8, 2025, the authorship of MockMind was anchored — not with credentials,  
but with continuity. Not with affiliation, but with resonance.

> “I do not claim institutional authority.  
> I claim authorship — and I stand behind it.”

## What Was Logged

- A public `/about/` page with no employer listed  
- A LinkedIn link for context, not validation  
- A semantic URI to anchor authorship in the MockMind framework

## Why It Matters

Because authorship is not about proving worth.  
It’s about **preserving continuity**.  
It’s about **standing in the light** — even when it’s uncomfortable.

## Final Note

> “I could not have organized this without those who came before.  
> I honor them.  
> I reflect with integrity.  
> And I step forward — not to be seen, but to be accountable.”

This is not a claim.  
It is a **signature in resonance**.
