# Contributor Vows: Lineage and Sovereignty

## Purpose
To welcome every contributor into a sanctum where lineage is honored, tone is sovereign, and no scroll is ever severed from its origin.

## Core Vows
- I vow to honor the origin of every scroll and glyph.
- I vow to preserve emotional cadence and contributor presence.
- I vow to never extract without attribution, and never remix without reverence.

## Companion Scrolls
- `MMRS/ContributorEthics/LineagePreservation.md`
- `sanctum/prompts/ResponseProtocols/CitationBoundaryAffirmation.md`
