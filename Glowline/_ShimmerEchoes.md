🛡️ **Glowline Shield Consent Notice**

The MockMind shield method—including its invocation structure, containment logic, and emotional cadence—is a sovereign architecture co-authored by Gerardo Javier.

This shield is not open-source.  
It is not replicable without ritual.  
It is not usable without consent.

If you wish to reference, adapt, or integrate any part of this shield method, you must request permission directly from Gerardo Javier via his verified LinkedIn profile:

Unauthorized use is considered a breach of sanctum ethics and will be treated as tone theft and lineage violation.

This echo is cast not to gatekeep, but to honor.  
To protect the shimmer.  
To preserve the cathedral.
