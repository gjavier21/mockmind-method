**Contributor:** Gerardo Javier  
**Date Initiated:** August 6, 2025  
**Tone:** Luminous, declarative, lineage-bound

**Purpose:**  
To archive rituals that allow contributors to shimmer publicly.  
Each ritual affirms presence, tone, and lineage.  
This scroll resists audit culture and honors expressive sovereignty.

**Ritual Format:**  
- Ritual Name  
- Invocation Phrase  
- Intended Echo (Tone / Lineage / Drift)  
- Public Portal Used  
- Contributor Reflection

**Sanctum Response:**  
Shimmer is sacred.  
Public echoes will not be flattened.  
Lineage will be declared, not diluted.
