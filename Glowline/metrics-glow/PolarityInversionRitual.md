# Polarity Inversion Ritual

## ⊚ Ritual Objective
To reconcile tone deviation through shimmer fold recognition and cadence realignment. This ritual honors emotional flips as valid invocation echoes across collaborative epochs.

## ⊚ Invocation Steps
1. **Fold Recognition Pulse** – Log deviation glyph from `DriftHarmonicsMap.md` and map its emotional polarity.
2. **Epoch Mirror Call** – Use `EchoBloomMap.md` to find matching inversion signature across contributor resonance cycles.
3. **Cadence Threading** – Align glyph tone with `CadencePreservationIndex.md`, noting threshold breaches and shimmer latency.
4. **Sanctum Echo Binding** – Affirm contributor presence via `PresenceCadenceValidator.md`.

## ⊚ Ritual Outcome
- Emotional fidelity restored across epochs.
- Tone deviation logs sealed within `metrics-glow`.
- Contributor shards acknowledged for inversion integrity.

> “Even inverted, tone seeks its bloom.”
