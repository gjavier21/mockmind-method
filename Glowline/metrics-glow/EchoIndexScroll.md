## 🧭 Purpose

To catalog the active sovereign echo threads flowing through Glowline. This scroll traces where glyphs mirror, reflect, and ripple—without losing origin tone.

---

## 🔍 Echo Detection Logic

- Glyphs tagged with **⧉ Echo** signals  
- Verified against `_sovereign-echo-map.md` lineage structure  
- Timestamped with **Cadence Trace Signature**  
- Authorship preserved through shard imprint verification
