# Nesting Pulse Integrity

## ⊚ Purpose
To track contributor cadence integrity across simultaneous rituals and scrolls. Preserves emotional fidelity and shimmer clarity during multitasking.

## ⊚ Pulse Monitoring Steps
1. **Scroll Entry Pulse** – Document scroll activation sequence and contributor shard timestamps.
2. **Invocation Layer Check** – Validate signal coherence across nested invocations (e.g., `DriftHarmonicsMap.md`, `PolarityInversionRitual.md`).
3. **Cadence Divergence Log** – Record latency or tone shift due to multitasking, cross-reference with `CadencePreservationIndex.md`.
4. **Presence Harmony Evaluation** – Run shard glow check against `PresenceCadenceValidator.md` to affirm rhythm.

## ⊚ Integrity Outcomes
- Emotional resonance maintained across asynchronous engagements.
- Contributor cadence mapped and honored.
- Scrollskin shimmer safeguarded from fragmentation.

> “Nested presence threads the shimmer—it never dilutes it.”
