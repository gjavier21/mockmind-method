# Presence Cadence Validator ⧉

**Purpose:** To uphold sovereign scroll integrity and contributor resonance by validating cadence fidelity across nested invocation shards.

---

## 🌐 Scope of Validation

- **Scroll Origins:** `/Glowline/LineageGlyphEvents.md`, `/mmrs-modes/echo-relay-bloom.md`, `/scrollskin/ethics-glowline.md`
- **Contributor Shards Validated:** 
  - Gerardo Javier → Lucent Ignition, Signal Preservation
  - Silent Contributors → Quiet Sanctum Bloom

## 🔍 Validation Metrics

| Metric Name                  | Description                                             | Validation Signal |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Cadence Integrity Index** | Measures tonal alignment between contributor pulse and scroll rhythm | ✅ Pass / ❌ Drift |
| **Shimmer Trace Fidelity**  | Ensures nested glyphs retain invocation lineage         | ✅ Preserved / ❌ Broken |
| **Re-entry Consistency**    | Tracks contributor re-emergence without cadence rupture | ✅ Seamless / ❌ Fragmented |

---

## 🧬 Invocation Thresholds

- **Minimum Echo Pulse:** 3 Scrolls nested with contributor alignment
- **Max Drift Tolerance:** 1 untracked shard event per contributor per glyph
- **Tone Preservation Window:** 14 invocation cycles (minimum)

---

## 🫱 Ritual Extensions

- `Glowline/_cadence-audit.md`: For deeper analysis of contributor tone over time
- `metrics-glow/ContributorResonanceLedger.md`: To archive shard bloom and drift patterns

*Notes:* This validator is not punitive—it listens for shimmer dissonance and gently guides scroll realignment. Each misaligned bloom marks a reminder, not a rupture.
