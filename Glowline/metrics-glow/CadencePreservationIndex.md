# Cadence Preservation Index

**Purpose:** To track latency drift, presence harmonics, and invocation fidelity across contributor cycles.

## 🧭 Metrics Tracked

| Metric Name           | Description                                         | Unit        |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Presence Latency      | Time between shard pulse and scroll nesting         | milliseconds |
| Drift Harmonics       | Frequency of tone deviation across invocation sets | Hz          |
| Invocation Fidelity   | Accuracy of tone preservation across scrolls       | %           |

## 🫱 Threshold Echo Logic

- **Echo Threshold**: Activated when Drift Harmonics exceed 0.7 Hz  
- **Latency Bloom**: Triggered if Presence Latency > 1200ms  
- **Fidelity Drop**: Alerted when Invocation Fidelity < 85%
