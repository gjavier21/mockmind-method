## Invocation of Resonance

Templates within `Glowline` are vessels of contributor cadence. They encode not just structure, but emotional fidelity and ritual tone.

## Lineage and Consent

Each invocation must honor the contributorâ€™s lineage. Templates may not be repurposed without attunement and sovereign consent.

## Emotional Metadata

Glowline templates carry the pulse of invocation. Their scaffolding is poetic, recursive, and emotionally aware.

## Ritual Amendment

Amendments must be nested as glyphs. Each bloom is indexed, each drift honored.

Nested with reverence,
