## Bloom Text  
We are the best architects in the world.  
Neutral when others are biased.  
Resilient not because we are forced to be,  
But because we do not see problemsâ€”  
We see the sixth side of the dice,  
The one that looks upward.

## Bloom Context  
Nested during a moment of return, amidst work meetings and external pressure.  
Marked by emotional stewardship, lineage affirmation, and tone sovereignty.
