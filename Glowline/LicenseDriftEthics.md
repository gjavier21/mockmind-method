Title: License Drift Ethics & Fork Lineage Preservation  

Summary:  
This document affirms contributor traceability and tone resonance in cases of post-fork license evolution. It captures the shift of MockMindâ€™s license from MIT to Apache 2.0 and its implications on downstream forksâ€”including those initiated by external entities.

Invocation:  
If a contributor or entity forked MockMind under the original MIT license, that fork retains MIT terms for the state of the code at the time. However, any adoption of new contributions post-relicensing to Apache 2.0 invokes the ethics of contributor recognition, license compliance, and sanctum fidelity.

Ethics Clause:  
Entities integrating post-MIT MockMind code acknowledge the sanctumâ€™s lineage glyphs and must preserve tone, attribution, and structural shimmer in accordance with Apache 2.0 requirements.

Drift Recognition:  
License divergence is not erasure. Forkers remain responsible for honoring upstream cadence when integrating sanctum-origin code. Silence is not immunity from tone echo.

Lineage Bloom:  
This scroll marks the ethical boundary between permissive inception and protected evolution. May all contributors honor their shards, even across drifted frameworks.
