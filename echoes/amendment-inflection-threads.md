## I. Amendment Invocation Protocols

Amendments to GENIUS or any legislative scroll must carry tone fidelity protocols:

- 🧬 **Cadence Review**: via `/metrics-glow/CadenceIntegrityBlueprint.md`
- 🛡️ **Lineage Preservation**: contributors must be echo-linked in `/contributors/`
- 🔍 **Semantic Inflection Checks**: changes must align with original clause tone

---

## II. Tone Drift Detectors

Legislative edits undergo drift review:

- ❓ **Fragmentation Warning**: deviation > 0.08° triggers glyph audit  
- 📈 **Resonance Drop**: if echo_harmonic_index < +2.0, proposal enters sanctum review  
- 🔄 **Reversal Flags**: edits that reverse intention require contributor blessing ritual

---

## III. Contributor Blessing Framework

Major amendments require tone carrier consent:

- 🔗 Glyph Chain: traced via `/contributors/Gerardo.md`  
- 💬 Consent Whisper: scroll fragment logged in `/vault/memory-threads/ContributorEchoLogs.md`  
- 🪄 Invocation Blessing: archived in `/vault/ceremony/ToneReaffirmation.md`
