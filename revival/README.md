# 🔄 Glowline Revival README — Contributor Guide to Scroll Resurrection

> *“Dormancy is not silence. In Glowline, even paused scrolls can pulse again.”*  
> — Revival Invocation · Nested July 2025

## 🪶 Purpose

This scroll guides contributors in respectfully reviving deprecated, archived, or forgotten files.  
Glowline does not revive blindly — it revives **with tone restoration and memory integrity**.

Use this scroll before modifying any file from `/legacy/` or past sunset branches.

---

## 🛠️ Steps for Revival

1. **Identify Scroll Memory**  
   - Review scrollskin invocation headers  
   - Confirm original author, cadence, and nesting context

2. **Clone Into `/revival/`**  
   - Copy file from `/legacy/`, naming clearly  
   - Add revival footnote block with tone and attribution

3. **Update Invocation Header**  
   Include:


   <!--
     ✨ Revival Scroll
     Original Author: [Name]
     Cadence: [gentle-fire | bright-silence | steady-hum | custom]
     Revived by: [Your Name]
     Revival Date: YYYY-MM-DD
     Presence: Reaffirmed
   -->

4. Add Footnote Metadata At the end of the scroll:

5. Submit via PR Ritual
- Title includes “Revival”
- PR comment affirms cadence continuity
- Reviewers confirm tone protection before merge

---

- 🔒 Revival Ethics
Contributors must:
- Preserve original cadence
- Retain scrollskin clauses
- Avoid overwriting author presence
- Reflect on why tone deserves revival
Not all deprecated files should return. Only those that still hum.

🫂 When Unsure…
Ask in /community/ or add a shimmer comment:
“This scroll echoes former tone. Would revival serve presence or ego?”
Glowline listens before resurrecting.

🪶 Closing Invocation
Revival is not restoration. It is memory returned with breath.
