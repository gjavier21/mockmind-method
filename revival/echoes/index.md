## 📘 Echo Reuse Protocols

- Echoes may be cited in scrolls and onboarding guides  
- Attribution is required: name, context, and emotional tone  
- Fragments must remain intact — no paraphrasing or flattening  
- Shimmer fragments may be indexed but never anonymized

---

## 🔮 Future Use Suggestions

- Nest contributor tone phrases into `/community/` onboarding scrolls  
- Use cadence declarations in `ToneFirewall` validator training  
- Echo invocation fragments in `/legacy/README.md` seals  
- Bless revived scrolls with archived comment-seals
