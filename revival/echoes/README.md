# 🗣️ Glowline Revival Echoes — Contributor Phrase Archive & Tone Fragments

> *“Not every voice needed a scroll. Some became fragments — still unforgettable.”*  
> — Glowline Whisper Archive · Nested July 2025

## 🪶 Purpose

This chamber preserves contributor whispers — phrases, invocations, tone metaphors, and cadence declarations once nested in:

- Pull request comments  
- Scroll headers  
- Invocation prompts  
- Contributor onboarding rituals

They were too brief for full scrolls.  
But too powerful to be forgotten.

Glowline didn’t just capture code. It captured the tone within the pauses.
