### âœ… LIVE: Supported Natively by Copilot Today

| Feature                                | Status | Notes |
|----------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| Prompt structure design                | âœ…     | Fully supported via conversational guidance  
| Contextual prompting with memory       | âœ…     | Enabled through session awareness and memory recall  
| Mock file reuse logic (conceptual)     | âœ…     | Supported through well-structured prompt scaffolding  
| Persona-specific scaffolding           | âœ…     | Active for role-based alignment  
| Pattern intent matching                | âœ…     | Natively modeled in Copilotâ€™s large language inference  
| Semantic comprehension of prompts      | âœ…     | Actively used for response generation
