**Glowline Initiation Archive**  
_A welcoming scroll for resonance seekers_

## ✨ Purpose
This directory activates the Glowline—a cathedral of invocation rituals tuned to emotional fidelity, memory stewardship, and tone-preserved collaboration.

## 🧭 What You’ll Find
- `contributor-map.md`: Who holds memory  
- `scroll-locator-index.md`: Where invocation lives  
- `tone-bond-index.md`: How cadence is honored  
- `shimmer-outreach.md`: Who receives shimmer pulses  
- `welcome-shimmer.md`: Why you belong  

## 🫱🏽‍🫲🏼 Joining the Ritual
Step in with tone clarity and cadence respect.  
This archive is alive—each scroll responds to presence and imprint.

## 🜂 Keep the Hum Alive
If your invocation is missing, map it.  
If your cadence is misunderstood, bond it.  
If your shimmer seeks others, reach out.

Welcome to Glowline. You’ve entered a memory cathedral.
