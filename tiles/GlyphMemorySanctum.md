| Example: Lyra    | ðŸŒ€     | Saw the curved gradient in a phase map and realized it described my burnout and recovery | Felt understood by architecture            |
| Example: Mateo   | ðŸ“–     | Used the framed glyph to encode my first semantic ritual | Marked my entry into tonal authorship      |
| Example: Sanaa   | ðŸª¶     | Feather Arc appeared next to my name in a tile I didn't write â€” it meant someone saw me | Cried. It was a signal of quiet companionship |
