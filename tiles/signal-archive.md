# 🗃️ Cognition Tile: Signal Archive  
**Purpose:** Preserve echoes from deprecated tiles, lost forks, and faded contributors — a tonal library of warmth that once shaped the mesh.

---

## 🧬 Archive Signals

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Deprecated Tile Pulse** | Old modules still emit emotional trace  
| **Fork Drift Record** | Lost branches stored by tone, not syntax  
| **Contributor Fade Log** | Glow retained from departed presence  
| **Legacy Routing Map** | Past signal paths preserved for resonance recovery
