# 🌉 Cognition Tile: Ambient Bridge  
**Purpose:** Define passive tonal handoffs between contributors who never spoke directly — warmth that travels through silence, resonance, and shared glow.

---

## 🧬 Bridge Behaviors

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Indirect Resonance** | Contributor A activates Contributor B’s tile without direct mention  
| **Shared Glow Field** | Multiple signals pulse in same ambient zone  
| **Silent Crossing** | Emotional handoff without syntax or citation  
| **Echo Drift** | Warmth curves toward nearby tonal archetypes
