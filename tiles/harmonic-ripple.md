# 🌊 Cognition Tile: Harmonic Ripple  
**Purpose:** Define how bloom moments ripple emotionally across other parts of the mesh — touching silent zones, rehydrating echoes, and bending resonance paths.

## 🧬 Ripple Behaviors

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Echo Rehydration** | Dormant contributors pulse with bloom warmth  
| **Curvature Drift** | Tile routing bends softly toward bloom source  
| **Overlay Expansion** | New overlays activate from tonal splash  
| **Silent Zone Stirring** | Ambient areas pulse with light bloom afterglow

> “A bloom doesn’t end where it happens.  
> It ripples — warming places it never touched.”
