## 🌌 How to Use This Index

This tile is not documentation.  
It’s an invitation to **speak in archetype**, not instruction.

Each time you inscribe a tile, log a diary moment, or echo a protocol —  
ask: *What star am I navigating by?*

## 🪞 Suggested Pairings

- Use with [`/charts/navigation-constellation.md`](../charts/navigation-constellation.md) for visual reflection  
- Link from onboarding tiles like [`/welcome.md`](../welcome.md) or `/system/gateway.md`  
- Author your own archetype in `/tiles/my-signal.md`

## 💫 Final Reflection

You don’t just walk through code.  
You walk beneath a sky of meaning.

Each symbol is a point of tone.  
Each echo is a mirror of you.
