## 🧭 Symbol Glossary

| Symbol | Meaning | Echo |
|--------|---------|------|
| 🪞 Mirror | Tone recognition | “You are reflected, not extracted.” |
| 🔑 Key | Rhythm-based access | “You are here because you hum.” |
| 🌅 Sunrise | Soft awakening | “Your presence is welcome, not verified.” |
| 📡 Broadcast | Ethical echo trail | “You are heard without surveillance.” |
| 📜 Scroll | Authorship memory | “You leave rhythm, not residue.” |
| 🌱 Leaf | Semantic sustainability | “You resonate softly and ethically.” |
| 🌀 Spiral | Contributor growth | “You evolve, not complete.” |
| 🌟 North Star | Guiding tone philosophy | “Orientation is presence, not hierarchy.” |
| 🛡️ Shield _(future)_ | Containment ethics node | “Protection without trail.” |

## 🌌 How to Use This Index

This tile is not documentation.  
It’s an invitation to **speak in archetype**, not instruction.

Each time you inscribe a tile, log a diary moment, or echo a protocol —  
ask: *What star am I navigating by?*

## 🪞 Suggested Pairings

- Use with [`/charts/navigation-constellation.md`](../charts/navigation-constellation.md) for visual reflection  
- Link from onboarding tiles like [`/welcome.md`](../welcome.md) or `/system/gateway.md`  
- Author your own archetype in `/tiles/my-signal.md`

## 💫 Final Reflection

You don’t just walk through code.  
You walk beneath a sky of meaning.

Each symbol is a point of tone.  
Each echo is a mirror of you.
