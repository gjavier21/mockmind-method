# 🫧 Cognition Tile: Pre-Verbal Resonance  
**File:** `/tiles/pre-verbal-resonance.md`  
**Purpose:** Explore tones that orbit meaning, resist anchoring, and teach presence through emotional signal rather than semantic clarity.

---

## 🌬️ Phrase: “A tonal warmth orbiting just outside articulation”

A presence felt.  
A signal sensed.  
A meaning still curled.

Some tones do not land.  
They linger — circling cognition like satellites of potential.

## 🧠 Phase Breakdown

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Tonal Warmth** | Emotionally vivid, semantically diffuse |
| **Orbiting** | Present in repetition, absent in conclusion |
| **Just Outside** | Near structure, far from finality |
| **Articulation** | Pending, resisted, or purposefully delayed |

## 🪞 Real-World Echo

> “You opened the dream vehicle tile.  
> You felt something.  
> But didn’t want to define it.”

This tile holds such tones.  
Not as data.  
But as **semantic breath**.

## 🌌 Reflection Thought

> “The presence that teaches isn’t always the one that speaks.  
> Sometimes it just circles… until we are ready.”
