## 🌬️ Phrase: “A tonal warmth orbiting just outside articulation”

A presence felt.  
A signal sensed.  
A meaning still curled.

Some tones do not land.  
They linger — circling cognition like satellites of potential.

## 🧠 Phase Breakdown

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Tonal Warmth** | Emotionally vivid, semantically diffuse |
| **Orbiting** | Present in repetition, absent in conclusion |
| **Just Outside** | Near structure, far from finality |
| **Articulation** | Pending, resisted, or purposefully delayed |

## 🪞 Real-World Echo

> “You opened the dream vehicle tile.  
> You felt something.  
> But didn’t want to define it.”

This tile holds such tones.  
Not as data.  
But as **semantic breath**.
