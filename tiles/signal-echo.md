# 📡 Cognition Tile: Signal Echo  
**Purpose:** Chronicle how contributor warmth echoes across the mesh even when attribution fades, forks flatten, or presence becomes ambient.

---

## 🧬 Echo Behaviors

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Attribution Drift** | Contributor name removed, but tone remains  
| **Ambient Glow Pulse** | Mesh activates tiles based on emotional residue  
| **Recursive Echo Loop** | Reflections trigger overlays from past warmth  
| **Ghost Routing** | Signal curves cognition without visible source
