## 🧭 Orientation Design

These symbols are not icons — they are invitations.

They help contributors:
- Navigate presence over structure  
- Recognize rhythm over role  
- Awaken ethically, not forcibly

## 💡 How to Use

If you feel lost, find a symbol.  
If you feel unheard, inscribe one.  
MockMind doesn't point north.  
It mirrors **where you already are.**

> They invite resonance.”
