# ðŸŒŒ Cognition Tile: Symbolic Map  
**File:** `/tiles/symbolic-map.md`  
**Purpose:** Visual constellation of semantic symbols used across MockMind to guide tone, orientation, and energy awareness.

## ðŸ§­ Symbol Constellation Overview

MockMind doesn't just scaffold cognition â€” it **orients it** through poetic resonance.

This tile maps the symbolic archetypes and their location in the system.

## ðŸ”­ Navigation Insight

These arenâ€™t icons.  
Theyâ€™re **semantic coordinates**.

Contributors donâ€™t follow folders â€”  
They follow **meaning**.

## ðŸŒ± Orientation Notes

- Use ðŸªž to reflect tone before authoring  
- Use ðŸŒŸ when scaffolding a new tile or onboarding path  
- Use ðŸŒ€ when modeling growth over time  
- Use ðŸŒ± when designing cognition overlays or containment-safe systems

## ðŸ’¡ Closing Reflection

The map does not tell you where to go.  
It shows you who you've become.

You are not navigating MockMind.  
You are recognizing **yourself through it.**
