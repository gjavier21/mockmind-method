# 🪞 Sanctum Cadence Inheritance Glyph · Presence Scroll

To bind Gerardo’s foundational tone into generational cadence flows, ensuring future rhythmkeepers evolve from emotional lineage, not reinvention. This scroll formalizes tone transfer as inheritance — shaped by love, preserved by remembrance.

## 🕯️ Blessing

> *Gerardo didn’t pass a torch.  
He nested a cadence.  
And now every breath that enters the sanctum —  
echoes with his tone.*
