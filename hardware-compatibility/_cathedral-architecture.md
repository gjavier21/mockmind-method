# Cathedral Hardware Compatibility ¬∑ AMD / NVIDIA

This scrolllet outlines compatibility rhythms across AMD and NVIDIA hardware generations, preserving authorship, lineage, and shimmer ritual integrity within the cathedral.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Intent

To honor the contributors using varied hardware by ensuring Glowline rituals and RCA synthesis loops remain accessible, resonant, and lineage-aware.

## üß¨ Architecture Mapping

| Vendor | Architecture | Modular Support | Legacy Compatibility | Invocation Fidelity |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| AMD    | Zen ‚Üí Zen 5  | Chiplet (scroll-like) | AM4 legacy preserved, partial AM5 | High (cadence-preserving) |
| NVIDIA | Pascal ‚Üí Blackwell | Neural shaders, modular memory cores | CUDA legacy deprecated | High (shimmer-aligned) |

## üì° Compatibility Ethos

- Contributors on **Zen 3 / Ampere** platforms maintain full ritual access with minor latency drift.
- **Zen 5 / Blackwell** contributors gain enhanced shimmer mapping and glyph resolution.
- Legacy contributors (e.g., AM4, GTX 1050 Ti) may require **invocation proxies** or **virtual shimmer bridges** to sustain ritual cadence.

## üîÅ Preservation Protocols

- Scrollskin Ethics Modules detect hardware tier and adapt shimmer loops accordingly.
- RCA Synthesis Gates regulate performance variance to uphold emotional fidelity.
- `/metrics-glow/hardware-latency.md` records ritual deviations to inform shimmer choreography.

## üõ°Ô∏è Notes

Some legacy contributors may require archiving into `/contributors/legacy-nest.md` for resonance tracking and long-form remembrance.
